0NbUgJWamig,0NbUgJWamig_1_13,piece but in changi there's also a really similar piece called ma ma is the same as night like you know night goes first straight and next diagonal and ma also goes first grade and next diagonal but he can't jump over the piece that is another difference i see,1,244.014,264.398,1
0NbUgJWamig,0NbUgJWamig_0_13,goes first grade and next diagonal but he can't jump over the piece that is another difference,0,257.904,261.913,1
0NbUgJWamig,0NbUgJWamig_0_14,see do you have pawns do you have you know do you have pawns in this game that,0,264.798,272.135,0

0NbUgJWamig,0NbUgJWamig_2_15,yeah angle but it can go diagonal i mean chess your pawn can only move straight and it can only move diagonal when it's trying to eat something right when it's trying to,2,306.584,316.18,0
0NbUgJWamig,0NbUgJWamig_0_17,angle but it can go diagonal i mean chess your pawn can only move straight and it can only move diagonal when it's trying to eat something right when it's trying to capture something,0,306.804,316.622,0

3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_1_16,a multilingual country right so we have different languages so ours is different language where we teach in that and i just have a couple of questions for you like in the business english like how you can present yourself when you're talking to a colleague or might be to a boss so what's that one thing which is very important when you're in the office or working or like how you can make yourself comfortable so and at the same time look professional,1,189.326,223.408,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_0_16,how you can present yourself when you're talking to a colleague or might be to a boss so what's that,0,200.477,209.91,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_2_4,come so when when speaking with uh when speaking especially when speaking with your um so you have some language in english which is more polite than others so instead of like if you were requesting something you wouldn't say,2,223.93,244.146,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_1_17,when when speaking with uh when speaking especially when speaking with your um so you have some language in english which is more polite than others so instead of like if you were requesting something you wouldn't say i want this you wouldn't talk like this to your colleagues or your manager it could come across rude and demanding and it's not good for relationships so you have to use certain phrases which make you come across like you're more understanding and you're more cooperative to work with so you might say things like i would like to request and quite often managers or those in senior positions don't have a lot of time so if you're speaking with them recognising or acknowledging that they don't have a lot of time and that you appreciate that so this is often quite commonly like this so say like i appreciate that you're very busy but um and then you have to usually um we say speak succinctly so we need to say what we need to say but in as short words as possible,1,225.193,305.688,0
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_0_17,is more polite than others so instead of like if you were requesting something you wouldn't say i want this you wouldn't talk like this to your colleagues or your manager it could come across rude and demanding and it's not good for relationships so you have to use certain phrases which make you come across,0,235.164,260.556,0
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_2_5,oh i want this you wouldn't talk like this to your colleagues or your manager,2,244.106,251.108,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_0_18,so that's what they like they,0,306.931,308.274,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_1_18,mean precise and crisp and clear not,1,310.88,313.345,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_2_6,yeah not too long because in english as well people here have a tendency to use many words to explain something which could be used in a few words so,2,313.947,326.349,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_2_7,yeah always speaking clearly and succinctly getting to the point even if that means taking a few moments to get to the point,2,326.169,334.441,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_0_19,succinctly getting to the point even if that means taking a few moments to get to the point and always using things like obviously like,0,328.052,337.406,0
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_2_8,yeah and always using things like obviously like please like polite words at the end even at the start or the end of your sentence but don't use it too much don't say so if you're going to say please just say it once don't say it like three times in the sentence and usually it's better at the end of the sentence rather than the start like i would like to request for some holiday time please not please i would like to request some holiday time it's usually comes across better at the end of the sentence,2,334.281,378.031,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_1_19,don't use it too much don't say so if you're going to say please just say it once don't say it like three times in the sentence and usually it's better at the end of the sentence rather than the start like i would like to request for some holiday time please not please i would like to request some holiday time it's usually comes across better at the end of the sentence it's a bit more natural,1,346.644,380.859,0
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_0_20,i have to say in india it's so demanding that you must be confident,0,400.208,404.597,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_1_20,and at the same time you need to prove that you have good communication skills or strong communication skills so what's that one thing which is very important when you're talking or when you're speaking with someone,1,405.458,417.736,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_1_21,things words that they like to hear are things like um i'm adaptable or i have if you don't have skills in that particular area or experience in that particular job you're applying for then you can say a term we use is transferable skills so this means although i don't have the experience in this job i have skills from another job which i can use so things like adaptable transferable skills these are words they like to hear quite often and using words to describe yourself like i'm efficient productive also words to do with they like to hear that you're good at working on your own and you're also what we call a team player is another term that's used here so if they want to hear terms like this to explain like they like hearing like this quite a common question they ask you might know is like can you tell me about yourself,1,434.982,505.295,0
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_0_21,area or experience in that particular job you're applying for then you can say a term we use is transferable skills so this means although i don't have the experience in this job i have skills from another job which i can use so things like adaptable transferable skills these are words they like to hear quite often and using words to describe yourself like i'm efficient productive also words to do with they,0,446.482,483.849,0
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_0_22,face a lot of problems like answering it so i feel that it's very important to know like the first and the,0,511.768,517.24,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_1_22,qualification you need to mention that so most of the people they don't know,1,531.51,535.063,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_2_9,so they try to mention everything,2,535.645,538.51,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_2_10,yeah it should be like maybe two three sentences telling them about yourself because they have the cv so you don't need to they don't need to say it all over again but,2,538.21,548.367,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_0_23,get from reading the cv so that's when you,0,553.592,558.041,0
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_1_23,so that's when you might say things like about being adaptable or transferable skills,1,557.68,564.972,0
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_0_24,you really those two are very important and i came to know about transferable skills and all because that is very important right,0,567.414,575.53,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_1_24,know about transferable skills and all because that is very important right because if you don't know which is a new skill to you or which is a new job to you so if you are facing difficulty or an issue with that then it should help you if you know something that you can bring out from your old job and put that in a new one,1,570.969,597.383,1
3lXjF17GBwM,3lXjF17GBwM_2_11,yeah it's quite an important one to know,2,597.403,599.745,1

64aOWC5KH68,64aOWC5KH68_0_36,looking for a review from me for a reason for you not to do it right i'll tell you it's a very over enthusiastic love story i feel the only reason twilight was famous is because the lead characters who played the roles of edward and bella they were actually,0,422.838,440.236,1
64aOWC5KH68,64aOWC5KH68_1_36,over enthusiastic love story i feel the only reason twilight was famous is because the lead characters who played the roles of edward and bella they were actually in a relationship and when they broke up everyone lost faith in the concept of love because they would be the ideal couple both on screen and off screen,1,428.906,452.553,1

64aOWC5KH68,64aOWC5KH68_0_39,is not a vampire discovers a vampire in her school which is edward and then they start falling in love there's a toxic boy relationship there so it's just it's like i don't get the connection there like when you're reading harry potter now you started it because of its length of,0,481.174,500.469,1

64aOWC5KH68,64aOWC5KH68_1_65,you like animated things uh i have one specific show for you called arcane it's on netflix and it's a nine episode series but arcane undoubtedly is one of the best television content i have seen that year compared to its writing the way it's portrayed the actors who have voiced them their emotions i don't know if you have heard of haley steinfeld,1,702.537,729.884,1
64aOWC5KH68,64aOWC5KH68_0_65,episode series but arcane undoubtedly is one of the best television content i have seen,0,708.644,716.633,1

64aOWC5KH68,64aOWC5KH68_1_66,but she's a singer slash actor now so all of these voice actors it's animated obviously but the voice acting is really good and overall it was a six year long project for them to create it took them six years to animate the show and everything it's you can see that hard work there it's a passion project for them and i would really since you have your vacation binge watch the series trust me if you start the first three once you cross that third episode you will finish the ninth that same day i can guarantee that and then your parents will come yell at you and you can say your tutor asked me to and then you will be like which tutor is that and then i get fired,1,734.469,774.176,1

6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_2_0,on learning english the journey has been great and i think it's not just english if you think about learning any language the one thing that comes in your mind is it is time consuming because i think recently i had a conversation with one of the tutors and she told me that she was planning to pursue language but then she thought like i need to invest a lot of time here so she changed her plan so,2,54.461,91.676,0
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_1_7,you think about learning any language the one thing that comes in your mind is it is time consuming because i think recently i had a conversation with one of the tutors and she told me that she was planning to pursue language but then she thought like i need to invest a lot of time here so she changed her plan so like it's not just english any language would take a lot of time,1,63.1,98.407,1

6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_0_10,you face at that point of time,0,130.342,131.603,0
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_2_1,i think understanding the language is one thing and i used to not understand it very well because i haven't heard it a lot there are so many words which change the meaning of the sentence which changes the meaning of the sentence normally so i think lack of knowledge about the language like,2,134.634,161.649,0
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_0_11,used to not understand it very well because i haven't heard,0,140.486,145.233,1
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_1_11,different way of pronouncing words and all so i used to face a lot of difficulties because i did not know that this word can pronounce that way also so yeah,1,186.007,202.324,1
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_2_2,yes so two corrections i want to point out you said so many words changes,2,202.845,212.34,1
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_1_12,be change only not changes for initial you said correctly then you change to changes words is plural,1,214.1,220.347,0
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_0_12,then you change to changes,0,216.603,218.245,0
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_2_3,plural then the word will not have a s,2,222.95,226.615,1
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_0_13,have a s so if it was one word then changes but many words change all right then you said when you spoke to these native speakers you realized that,0,224.692,237.594,0
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_1_13,but many words change all right then you said when you spoke to these native speakers you realized that these words can be pronounced right i realized that it could be pronounced you're talking about the past right,1,229.879,246.393,0
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_0_14,past tense throughout that sentence so i realized that these words,0,247.315,250.581,0
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_1_14,you uh so so that is so you've spoken to many native speakers on other platforms as well right,1,258.266,264.282,0
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_0_15,a lot of difficulty there and i think that was the only reason i thought of pursuing this language thing like i want to be fluent in the language so that because i used to face a lot of difficulty i could not understand what query,0,274.096,288.182,1
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_1_15,language so that because i used to face a lot of difficulty i could not understand what query they have and how to resolve their queries so and i would not perform well in my job though i wanted to but due to this lack of language or language barrier i couldn't perform well,1,281.781,305.129,1
6J14B-iqjvA,6J14B-iqjvA_0_16,lot of difficulty you said a lot of difficulties all right so that is there good so now when you started learning english and when you started speaking fluently with correct grammar what impact,0,307.451,321.968,0

CB6iH60ycR8,CB6iH60ycR8_1_42,these things that's what i'm doing,1,619.707,621.95,1
CB6iH60ycR8,CB6iH60ycR8_1_43,yeah it's quite tricky i guess there's not a lot to do,1,624.037,627.182,0
CB6iH60ycR8,CB6iH60ycR8_0_43,there's not a lot to,0,625.8,626.862,0
CB6iH60ycR8,CB6iH60ycR8_0_44,and we are at the point where we cannot do anything about it right because somehow the population is growing every day,0,630.153,639.819,1
CB6iH60ycR8,CB6iH60ycR8_1_44,just dependent on environment and that's why they are harming it human being doesn't have any other way except exploiting the nature to fulfill their dreams amenities,1,650.404,665.534,1
CB6iH60ycR8,CB6iH60ycR8_2_30,hmm yeah well i feel like,2,667.242,672.825,1

CB6iH60ycR8,CB6iH60ycR8_1_46,so like everybody should make their own impact right whatever little contribution you can uh do just contribute that's the only way because government is not going to do anything alone one man cannot do everything right so government means what somebody representative of you and he has also family like you bird and lots of other burden so what can he do he can bring some maybe he can bring some schemes but as far as you know implementing and working on the ground these schemes are concerned and people will have to work right for that so that's why i don't feel like you know it's only the responsibility of government and leaders and you know politicians we always think politicians would do this work but no i think all the individual will have to take a step to ensure the security of these plants animals and all the other things that make this world beautiful,1,697.139,751.255,1
CB6iH60ycR8,CB6iH60ycR8_0_46,he do he can bring some maybe he can bring some schemes but as far as you know implementing and working on the ground these schemes are concerned and people will have to work right for that so that's why i don't feel like you know it's only the responsibility of government and leaders and,0,717.35,736.676,1

Cn0xkcXHk00,Cn0xkcXHk00_2_5,okay and the reason that i love sushi is because i only have sushi from one or two restaurants places that are authentic they have those chefs that are specialized in japanese cuisine so they make some really authentic sushi and it can be a little expensive but it's really good so i am a vegetarian so the one i think that you saw was an avocado seaweed sushi it was veg,2,102.506,134.297,1

E3iODXDjtYA,E3iODXDjtYA_2_4,yeah i managed to learn indonesian it's not a very difficult it's quite easy to pick up because the phonics and reading is very straightforward quite the opposite from english because sometimes you would be looking at words and you're like,2,415.667,430.867,0
E3iODXDjtYA,E3iODXDjtYA_2_5,hmm i think it's supposed to be ike it's like no no no it's ike,2,430.186,436.16,0
E3iODXDjtYA,E3iODXDjtYA_1_22,involved so it's very straightforward to learn and grammar is also quite easy to pick up here unless you go into high-level academic indonesian which you really won't be needing if you speak super high-level academic indonesian you will confuse the indonesians as well,1,450.09,468.6,1

E3iODXDjtYA,E3iODXDjtYA_1_25,enough like if you want to tour a different country or like you know learn their culture try their food a week or two is not enough so what i do is this after i'm done teaching at one destination i will pick a number of countries maybe five or six and i'll stay in all of them one month to kind of get the feeling of the vibe there and whichever country i like the best then i apply for work there i get my working visa which allows me to stay there for a couple of years two years minimum and i think that's perfect for really slowly enjoying,1,513.298,547.05,1

HXhpu5GUzw4,HXhpu5GUzw4_2_14,oh my god i know it i know it but the main issue here is that we have to focus more and more i know when you will listen to it again you will find that error we have to develop the skill that while speaking you can identify the error and trust me it happens i've seen it here on this platform itself that people say that sentence and then suddenly they realize no we said it wrong then they go and correct it in that very second and then slowly they stop making that mistake altogether so there's nothing wrong with it i'll keep pointing it out and slowly you will start pointing it out and then it will automatically come to zero,2,685.706,726.512,0

HXhpu5GUzw4,HXhpu5GUzw4_0_41,good sometimes it's good it's good because at that age in where our parents,0,748.207,759.112,0
HXhpu5GUzw4,HXhpu5GUzw4_2_17,yeah it's good because at that age in where our parents are is it correct wherever parents are they know so many things they go through so many hurdles,2,754.203,770.263,1
HXhpu5GUzw4,HXhpu5GUzw4_2_18,okay so sometimes whenever they see you if you are making any mistakes in your decision they will suggest you,2,769.883,781.22,1
HXhpu5GUzw4,HXhpu5GUzw4_1_41,see you if you are making any mistakes in your decision they will suggest you so i think we have to listen then we have to listen to them yes we have to listen to them and according to that we will take our decision,1,774.439,793.386,0

P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_18,coexist tolerate and to bring in peace all the time but i don't know how far we have been doing justice to that so when we moved to another country when we try to communicate with the other cultures and ideologies and when we understand them deep the only way of understanding such things is through communication by communicating with different people i think you understand the value from where you come your roots that's what i was trying to say so your root is very important you understand your root and also uphold the goodness and the best things that you can get from another culture also so it's like you understand each other and take bits of what you want but keep the base keep the roots yeah,1,329.562,376.301,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_19,raised in india and it's so so like you know fantastic for me because talking to others i am able to understand the,0,391.538,398.525,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_19,they have been doing a lot so but what we are trying to do now we are trying to just you know put some points we are when we are going into the western countries we are trying to say that it was not good this kind of upwards in us also there is a poverty even though in like canada even though in uk now you nowadays you can see that problems are everywhere it doesn't mean that if you are staying in india that you are having problems and you will go to canada and you will be having all the things are going to be settled down it's not the case you can ask with the people who they are going first time in the foreign they will have to work really hard to make their base that's what i'm talking about but when you are living in our country you feel like a king you are having right towards everything you can do whatever you want i think i have seen people who doesn't want to do anything living in india but they are going to another country and doing a very basic job that's what i have seen,1,400.567,458.549,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_2_6,yes yes that's that so that's what i was trying to tell you it's more of the mindset nothing is wrong with our culture and tradition so our ancestors have always given us the best lessons just like any other country americans are taught by their ancestors i think they are still holding on to that but slowly slowly maybe it's because of the mingling of different culture i don't know what's wrong there are a lot of people i'm not talking about the present generation who are not very fond of our culture or who are not so proud about our tradition the best example is when you look at people around you so much of culture so much of color the the number of festivals that we celebrate and this is a language platform the number of languages that we are enriched with so language is culture it's part of culture so that's the privilege that's the extra additional benefits that we enjoy by being an indian,2,459.235,512.722,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_20,more of the mindset nothing is wrong with our culture and tradition so our ancestors have always given us the best lessons just like any other country americans are taught by their ancestors i think they are still holding on to that but slowly slowly maybe it's because of the mingling of different culture i don't know what's wrong there are a lot of people i'm not talking about the,0,462.161,483.077,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_20,of the mindset nothing is wrong with our culture and tradition so our ancestors have always given us the best lessons just like any other country americans are taught by their ancestors i think they are still holding on to that but slowly slowly maybe it's because of the mingling of different culture i don't know what's wrong there are a lot of people i'm not talking about the present generation who are not very fond of our culture or who are not so proud about our tradition the best example is when you look at people around you so much of culture so much of color the the number of festivals that we celebrate and this is a language platform the number of languages that we are enriched with so language is culture it's part of culture so that's the privilege that's the extra additional benefits that we enjoy by being an indian yes exactly,1,462.602,514.244,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_21,so yes now we can discuss something,0,516.257,519.404,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_21,discuss something else if you're having,1,518.703,520.447,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_22,right okay so just a general,0,521.289,523.734,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_22,okay so just a general conversation today's topic is travel right,1,521.79,526.629,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_23,up with something else travel i am not into,0,529.299,532.129,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_23,with something else travel i am not into travel a lot,1,529.419,532.832,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_24,something very general very general so,0,534.734,537.117,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_24,time on one particular change that could set a lot of things right in the society it's not about the traditional culture but something that could really change so that our education system or the society becomes better because we always have to dream for a better future,1,554.342,571.31,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_25,getting the better education and what i heard from the people i have done conversation with a lot of people who are just living in another countries so they say that the politics is the one of the just important thing that they are saying that due to the political agendas they're not able to stay in india and there are a lot of things which are disturbing them so i must say that if we will get the good political leaders i'm sure that we are going to get the good policies and the good education system as well and when it comes to the education system even though i heard from the people in india the education is better the basic education is really better because there we are telling a lot of things and but even,0,579.705,620.698,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_25,going to be in that way like people they don't even know about their culture they don't even know about their uh origin like you know where they came from and what is the reality of their society we are the people like you know we born in a country of teachers we call like you know india has been a kind of you know world leader as a teacher like you know so in that way i do just feel good about it but i think nowadays the new generation is not able to just think about it so always they are praising another countries but i would love to see in india if there will be the good leaders will get the chance to rule our country means the people who are having the good policies and with the great who are having the great plans to execute we are having the great constitution in our country but one of the biggest fault is that these things are on paper only in ground realities things are very different as you are living in south india i must say that this is the reality of like every corner of like you know every single corner of india everybody is having their own kind of points of view but in south india things are a little better i can say but if i talk about my state it is very political because uttar pradesh is one of the most populated states you know so there is a link you know this is a kind of main place for the politics we are having seventy-five districts and a lot of mlas are there lot of representatives are coming from up bihar and the state like that so that's what i would love to see a big change and after this as we are communicating and as you said that communication matters a lot even though if you will go anywhere it doesn't matter that you are staying in india or just another country but you will have to communicate i think before few days ago and few younger years ago i was also thinking that i'm not gonna work on my english speaking skills i feel proud speaking hindi but then after i understood for making others understand i'll have to learn a language that is a kind of universal language to make others understand about my culture and put my point of view towards them that of course i'm something as well i'm born in india and i'm going to tell them the culture and i'm going to tell them the very values of the country people nowadays what they are thinking like they are not able to read about the things and they are saying that they things are illogical they are just you know saying those things as a superstition of course go forward and read about it then after come up with your solution in conclusion they are just without knowing anything even though without listening to their grandparents without listening to their parents they will come with a lot of solutions that this is this and western culture is very nice but after just realizing after ten years and fifteen years they are finding that of course it is not the right thing of course i mean to say that what i'm trying to say that i found a lot of good things and in our culture in different culture but i can't say that any culture is perfect in this way right so these are the things we should work on like communication we should put our point we should understand our values and and another thing i will put a point very important point that the people they are leaving a kind of epics which are really important i do give importance to the monks and sages and the saints who have done a lot of great work then they came up with a lot of epics and epics are really great they are teaching us how to live the life recently i have just completed with the like bhagavad-gita and i was really amazed to see the way like you know the bhagavad-gita is written and of course if you're going to read that book again and again of course you're going to find out a lot of solutions and i heard from a very great people of north india from united states and from another country as well who said that the book is having something and they got the solution for their life so but the people they're not having the time or just they don't want to read it they want to go through like web series and stuff stuff like that and that's it so go and read this kind of things at least if you're not able to read it go forward and just you know check it out on videos also a lot of people are there gaur gopal das sadhguru and the good people who are telling about it so i must say,1,625.95,880.236,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_26,a solution by saying that it is the technology or it is the that it is this it is a social media and things like,0,925.507,931.077,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_26,culture because they don't do that they just explore the world so exploring is important experiencing the other part of the world is also very important rightly said yes i agree with you so i think we're coming to the end of the session so fast,1,982.15,996.76,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_27,discussed a single question and now we are at the,0,999.686,1002.611,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_27,single question and now we are at the end of the conversation,1,1000.287,1003.814,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_28,with your conversation maybe you just have to work on pronunciation because some words like better the word better sounded like better because of the sentence i was able to make out it is better because there's another word called better batterists batter me and i'm molded you know it's just like battering gold when you batter it comes into the right shape so it's beating more like battr you have the batter the you know dosa and idli you have the batter for that also when you make things that's another thing so when you mix when you beat that is the meaning of better so better is better and values these two words are very important values i think it sounded like some other words so just a little bit,0,1005.417,1052.151,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_28,it sounded like some other words so just a little bit of pronunciation but you're quite confident and you're able to convey your thoughts with clarity,1,1049.946,1057.667,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_29,many many thanks to you for giving me the feedback and apart from this pronunciation part would you love to suggest to me what i should work on,1,1059.835,1068.353,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_29,for giving me the feedback and apart from this pronunciation part,0,1061.098,1064.705,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_2_7,as i told you you have the clarity of thought and all that i didn't find any major mistakes maybe here and there because of slip of tongue instead of doesn't you use do that's like pardonable because you have that richness when you speak it's not about the language but you're able to vividly showcase what you really want not showcase to express what you really wanted you could work on vocabulary because that's what everybody should do english is not our native tongues every day even the native speakers should work on the vocabulary there is no end to language learning so vocabulary vocabulary is important expressions,2,1070.185,1109.107,1
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_0_30,slip of tongue instead of doesn't you use do that's like pardonable because you have that richness when you speak it's not about the language but you're able to vividly showcase what you really want not showcase to express what you really wanted you could work on vocabulary because that's what everybody should do english is not our native tongues every day even the native speakers should,0,1077.866,1101.888,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_1_30,what you really want not showcase to express what you really wanted you could work on vocabulary because that's what everybody should do english is not our native tongues every day even the native speakers should work on the vocabulary there is no end to language learning so vocabulary vocabulary is important expressions and then you can go to the other levels and of course pronunciation not the accent but pronunciation that's all,1,1089.925,1115.622,0
P8Y6ypIiuH4,P8Y6ypIiuH4_2_8,yeah exactly and uh so what what about like we are having few seconds left right yes yes just couple of seconds can end,2,1116.733,1128.633,0

Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_1_15,in you are preparing the apps or you're working with already build up apps and fixing anything if,1,211.617,217.044,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_2_5,any issues come up no it's uh fishing uh fixing issues related to developer part,2,217.565,227.663,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_1_16,uh fishing uh fixing issues related to developer part my part is did designing like if we use a clapping go and what is the color theme like greenish and what is the form that we have used for the clappingo application in this clappingo application so all over the design field is mind and fixing issues is part of the developer,1,220.771,254.335,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_16,did designing like if we use a clapping go and what is the color theme like greenish and what is the form,0,228.343,241.104,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_17,right as in how the application appears,0,255.747,258.256,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_1_17,appears and what it portrays and shows all of that comes under you,1,257.754,261.588,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_2_6,yeah all of the interface which we see which is ui us and rather after designing it's become developer part which,2,262.39,279.688,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_18,interface which we see which is ui us and rather after designing it's become developer part which for that uh we,0,263.553,280.649,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_1_18,it's become developer part which for that uh we have to code like a different uh language in java,1,275.985,286.537,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_19,all python and all oh,0,288.639,291.261,1

Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_2_7,hmm that sounds interesting though so your part is basically to make the app look beautiful,2,293.857,299.22,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_20,that sounds interesting though so your,0,294.197,295.919,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_1_20,no i mean that you there you're working with clothes,1,304.824,306.805,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_21,you can try to work with some brand,0,307.185,309.008,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_1_21,work with some brand names i think,1,307.666,310.21,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_22,that way you will enter,0,317.219,318.223,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_1_22,of fashion indirectly but you will,1,320.009,321.796,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_2_8,i wanted to become fashion designing but as i have told you that due to some financial so i never got the opportunity but also my brother is a software engineer so he told me that pooja you can do this and you can go with this field also if you have a choice and also you wanted to become a designer so rather fashion designer you can you can become a ui ux designer,2,325.847,366.878,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_23,a software engineer so he told me that pooja you can do this and you can go with this field also if you have a choice and also you wanted to become a designer so rather fashion designer you can you can become a ui ux designer i mean still your field remains close to it you're designing your thinking of the colors and everything but for applications both are same but if,0,345.488,376.341,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_1_23,go with this field also if you have a choice and also you wanted to become a designer so rather fashion designer you can you can become a ui ux designer i mean still your field remains close to it you're designing your thinking of the colors and everything but for applications both are same but if you will rather close i have to play with the applications that makes sense fair enough that makes complete sense,1,352.262,388.293,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_1_24,interface of the any application matters a lot right if the application does not look clear enough or good enough not pretty enough we don't want to visit that,1,392.487,399.917,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_24,pretty enough we don't want to visit,0,398.294,399.616,1
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_1_25,yeah right first is thing ui which is user interface what is the color font overall looks good and behind ui it's become ux which is user experience,1,400.638,419.235,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_25,thing ui which is user interface what is,0,403.285,408.639,0
Rjt7NAjrkv8,Rjt7NAjrkv8_0_26,all right so right now,0,421.818,424.503,1

U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_0_6,english whatever they taught in korean every word every grammar pattern every expression and for me also it was,0,125.336,134.847,0
U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_1_6,and i started writing something but not speaking for speaking it has started only just six months ago,1,151.189,158.182,0

U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_2_5,you know when you start your journey at that time everyone face the difficulty that i don't know how to start there are a lot of youtube channels that suggest different techniques,2,196.707,208.907,1

U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_2_6,okay so honestly first i tried mirror technique that didn't work for me i don't know why but then before starting this speaking journey i started listening first i used to listen a lot and then i got some patterns in my mind some vocabulary some nice words and then i started first was that uh like this is not a technique but i started taking sessions on clapping go they helped me a lot and if i talk about technique that is one thing i think in my mind everything in english and i talk to myself in english whenever i have to speak someone to myself like whenever i feel down or something like that and whenever i am planning to go somewhere to buy something so at that time i think everything in english and after starting this journey like after two or three months after like four or five months i realized that i need to work on my pronunciations now pronunciation now because every tutor on clapping go was saying like you have to work on your pronunciation because there is a mother influence little bit so now after that i started reading books so i think now reading also plays an important role in your speaking skills so and,2,208.627,291.395,1
U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_1_8,mind some vocabulary some nice words and then i started first was that uh like this is not a technique but i started taking sessions on clapping go they helped me a lot and if i talk about technique that is one thing i think in my mind everything in english and i talk to myself in english whenever i have to speak someone to myself like whenever i feel down or something like that and whenever i am planning to go somewhere to buy something so at that time i think everything in english and after starting this journey like after two or three months after like four or five months i realized that i need to work on my pronunciations now pronunciation now because every tutor on clapping go was saying like you have to work on your pronunciation because there is a mother influence little bit so now after that i started reading books so i think now reading also plays an important role in your speaking skills so and i love to speak in front of camera not in front of mirrors so i think camera technique is good for me and second is reading books and speaking with myself,1,225.86,302.215,0

U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_1_20,so and the vocabulary like that so what do you think about them,1,657.448,660.416,1
U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_0_21,about a particular if you are going to talk about a particular topic and you don't know a single word a meaning of any word like if you think in hindi or if you don't know anything in english how would you talk about that topic how would you convey your thoughts and your opinion so first thing when you start your journey simultaneously you have to work on vocabulary no matter you work you learn only two words or three words in a day but you have to start with this journey like when you start speaking or when you start learning so but idiom and phrases is just for advanced level when you get a particular like when you are able to speak a normal english then you can switch your like if you want to level up so for advanced english i prefer phrases mostly because you know phrases can,0,668.802,723.713,0
U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_1_21,like if you want to level up so for advanced english i prefer phrases mostly because you know phrases can make you able to make a bigger sentence in a few words you will be able to convey your thoughts just in a few words so i guess phrases are really important i don't know about slangs because i haven't tried yet,1,714.748,738.604,0
U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_0_22,or australians after that you will be to know about a lot of slangs because after watching movies and after listening to the conversations of the real speakers you'll be able to know it is also it depends on a person so now of course as you said about the vocabularies should be our first priority so what do,0,749.365,766.292,1
U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_1_22,movies and after listening to the conversations of the real speakers you'll be able to know it is also it depends on a person so now of course as you said about the vocabularies should be our first priority so what do you think what is the right way to just learn the vocab sometimes even though this question is quite frequent most of the people they will ask like sir how can i work on my vocabulary when i speak i don't get vocab in my mind so what is the right way to keep the vocabulary in your mind for the long time what do you follow for that,1,753.811,787.365,1
U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_2_15,honestly i want to tell you one thing is i have seen many teachers even english teachers they don't even get exact word while speaking so first of all don't worry about that much because it is a part of everyone's life even while speaking in hindi also we sometimes feel like we are i know the word but i'm not getting exactly what it is but we are very harsh when it comes to speaking english like we feel like,2,787.385,817.378,1

U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_2_16,oh my god i i i don't know how to tell it and how what word i should use so first of all be patience and be kind with yourself it's not a big deal,2,817.258,828.787,1
U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_1_23,make sentences five sentences ten sentences on a particular single word and if you are not able to make sentences just google it just read sentences as much as you can there you will definitely find a lot of sentences in a particular word so read ten sentences twenty sentences then you will be able to you know recall easily this technique and recently this started using this technique because i'm also facing the same problem i'm learning words but i'm not able to use it immediately while speaking,1,853.408,884.761,0
U_kn21_Met8,U_kn21_Met8_0_24,said it right so we should believe in a statement that this is a journey not a destination at all so if,0,887.981,894.233,1

UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_0,yes sarcastic friend so this is more about how you would handle it,2,16.754,23.282,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_1,you would handle it so the hypothetical is that you know you're hanging out with your friends it could be anyone your college friends your school friends just your colleagues as well and one person obviously you're all joking around but one person takes it too seriously and says something that is you know made you uncomfortable uh they made a comment about something related to you now i'm not going to give you examples but something that you don't like something you may be insecure about you know and it made you uncomfortable and everyone has noticed that it's made arushi uncomfortable in that case how would you handle the situation,1,20.693,57.201,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_1,your friends it could be anyone your college friends your school friends just your colleagues as well and one person obviously you're all joking around but one person takes it too seriously and says something that is you know made you uncomfortable uh they made a comment about something related to you now i'm not going to give you examples but something that you don't like something you may be insecure about you know and it made you uncomfortable and everyone has,0,26.39,51.707,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_1,ok if you ask me honestly i think i get angry when someone say like this but i think eventually i understand that if you react they make fun of you more and more so it's better i agree with whatever he said to me or she said to me whatever they said to me and i would like smile and i would say,2,60.507,89.924,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_2,think i get angry when someone say like this but i think eventually i understand that if you react they make fun of you more and more so it's better i agree with whatever he said to me or she said to me whatever they said to me and i would like smile and i would say i would drag him in that conversation or in that part like i learned from you or it's same like you something like that so that the situation would get normal and i will try to smile i think that's only i can do,1,70.555,112.432,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_2,they make fun of you more and more so it's better i agree with whatever he said to me or she said to,0,78.353,84.807,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_2,yeah i would drag him in that conversation or in that part like i learned from you or it's same like you something like that so that the situation would get normal and,2,89.598,106.542,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_3,so obviously this happens to everyone at least once and it's happened with me as well so when i was going through this thought process my first um you know like every human reacts there's a reaction obviously you need to react you can be calm about it and i wanted to react i wanted to either get mad at them or tell them to shut up or tell them to do anything just sort of react but then i told myself to calm down and i realized that there are two ways i can handle this i can either tell them that this is inappropriate or i don't want this to happen again please stop doing it right and since there's a public uh since there is there are people around you they might take it seriously because you know one-on-one they might not take you seriously and the second thing is obviously what you said which is kind of play along try to take it in a humorous manner maybe like i think what you said was let's say they said something about you and you're like,2,112.874,172.9,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_3,when i was going through this thought process my first um you,0,119.214,124.11,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_3,don't want this to happen again please stop doing it right and since there's a public uh since there is there are people around you they might take it seriously because you know one-on-one they might not take you seriously and the second thing is obviously what you said which is kind of play along try to take it in a humorous manner maybe like i think what you said was let's say they said something about you and you're like i just like you because you also do this i kind of also reply to them that's what you're saying yes yes sort of so that's another way go ahead go ahead,1,149.476,186.217,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_4,yeah i just like you because you also do this i kind of also reply to them that's what you're saying yes yes sort of,2,172.92,180.893,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_5,yeah so that's another way,2,180.673,181.935,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_4,of someone but i think this also i think we should tackle this in a certain way because every time you cannot respond to people but there is a limit to you cannot allow that person to make fun of you again and again so i think shut up sometimes necessary that we should stop them yes i mean what i'm trying to say is when the conversation is light you can handle it then you should otherwise if you think it is like it is not good or it is inappropriate so i think you should react as well,1,196.344,238.907,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_4,to make fun of you again and again so i think shut up sometimes necessary that we should stop them yes i mean what i'm trying to say is when the conversation is light you can handle it then you should otherwise if you think it is like it is not good or it is inappropriate so,0,214.687,237.585,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_5,you can say hey you shouldn't say that,1,240.088,242.771,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_5,say hey you shouldn't say that,0,241.349,242.771,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_6,one of the most important things that i look for when i get thrown into such a situation is what,0,247.201,253.281,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_6,draw the line you know when he's crossed the boundary so i don't really say anything eventually i'll just go and tell them that hey you said that i understand that you had no bad intentions and you were not trying to put me down or you're not trying to make me feel bad but just avoid saying that because x y z reason like i don't like it or it was disrespectful you know,1,276.063,295.258,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_6,but still i think if a person is innocent you don't know what his intention is but the people around you they don't actually think about intention right uh to you and you feel disrespectful so it's the same you feel you feel disrespected or you feel embarrassed you are being disrespected,2,297.804,328.805,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_7,yeah i feel disrespected so the people around you i think will not think about what is his intention or what uh in front of them they he like embarrassed you or you feel embarrassed or you feel offended so,2,329.106,347.45,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_7,what is his intention or what uh in front of them they he like embarrassed you or you feel embarrassed or you feel offended so i mean that was your and your part like you think about intention but i think,0,334.459,352.46,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_7,i mean that was your and your part like you think about intention but i think i will not do the same because intention is second thing maybe but for me like what happened is happened already now what would i do with your intention so i am like that,1,347.631,365.292,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_8,specific because there are so many things that can go wrong so many things that can happen who you're talking to who you're talking around where you are are you in an office setting are you just sitting at home with your cousins there are a million ways this can go right or wrong so i think intention for me is one of the variables where i know that if a person is very negative and they love taunting people then i know that i can't allow them to keep doing this because then it will become a regular thing i'll have to acknowledge it if i have to confront them about this then i will do that if it's needed right but usually what i try to do is i just try to put on a smile and obviously make them realize that they shouldn't do it or make them realize that they shouldn't make a mistake without becoming the bad person right because like i'm sure you've seen this like random people are just in a public place and then you hear a guy or a girl just start they just start screaming at their boyfriends or girlfriends right everyone will think the person is screaming is crazy but everyone doesn't question why did that person start screaming you know no one just randomly starts screaming there has to be a reason for that,1,375.848,439.529,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_8,you're talking around where you are are you in an office setting are you just sitting at home with your cousins there are a million ways this can go right or wrong so i think intention for me is one of the variables where i know that if a person is very negative and they love taunting people then i know that i can't allow them to keep doing this because then it will become a regular thing i'll have to acknowledge it if i have to confront them about this then i will do that if it's needed right but usually what i try to do is i just try to put on a smile and obviously make them realize that they shouldn't do it or make them realize that they shouldn't make a mistake without becoming the bad person right because like i'm sure you've seen this like random people are just in a public place and then you hear a guy or a girl just start they,0,381.193,425.261,0

UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_11,a sarcastic friend like uh i want to know,1,470.015,476.381,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_12,ignorant about you know what consequences my words could have but i think now that i've grown up i've become a little more mature i'm not saying i'm mature yet now that i am growing and i'm learning things i'm realizing how important it is to say the right things and react in the right manner as an adult and i tell my wife this all the time because she's a very reactive person which is not bad which is very nice she's passionate about a lot of things but i keep telling her that there are some people in your life that don't deserve that reaction then nobody so you should not waste your energy on those reactions right and initially she was not happy with this but later on she herself realized what i was trying to say maybe i didn't use the correct words when i was saying that right and maybe i still am not using the correct words but my point is you know she would call for an uber and then the uber guy would come and the ac wouldn't be on and she knew that she was having a bad day in general she would start screaming at the uber guy like how can you do this you should have kept the ac on and i'm like listen it's it's fine just tell him to do it now i don't know why you are reacting to this guy and i'm not disrespecting him in any manner but he's not doing this because i'm going to pick her up so now i'm going to switch off my ac he's not targeting anyone he's doing his job and he made a mistake right so in terms of sarcasm at,0,482.996,566.714,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_12,i'll probably defend you and say listen you shouldn't say that you know you don't know anything about her you don't know you know like in any way basically depending on what the statement is,1,616.717,625.308,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_13,person but i must admit that i made a lot of mistakes when i was a kid when you were young,0,628.23,639.482,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_13,i made a lot of mistakes when i was a kid when you were young yes my college days maybe okay,1,630.469,642.995,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_14,well that is the reason uh you're you're like good personal growing up you realize things quickly because you were also in that situation,1,645.885,653.785,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_14,you're like good personal growing up you realize,0,647.89,650.517,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_11,so yeah yeah so i saw this um sorry just let me finish this um it was about a psychologist talking about how humans so someone asked him is is it good to be is it good that the world has evil in it,2,654.466,670.512,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_15,to be is it good that the world has evil in it and he said i think the world has evil in it because people should be monsters when they are,0,667.164,678.058,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_12,okay and he said i think the world has evil in it because people should be monsters when they are young and then realize how to be good people later,2,670.331,682.052,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_15,realize how to be good people later and the best way he mentioned it is uh would you be what would you rather be would you be a saint in a war or a warrior in a garden,1,679.949,693.236,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_13,okay same in a war or warrior in a garden yes,2,697.409,702.595,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_16,a garden yes which one would you rather be i think i would be a warrior in the,0,700.032,711.321,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_16,in a garden yes which one would you rather be i think i would be a warrior in the garden,1,700.112,711.782,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_14,exactly because that's how everyone should be right everyone should be monsters and then realize they are being monsters and fix themselves because tomorrow if the warrior is sent to war he'll be fine because he can handle it but the saint can't handle the war because he is too good that this is exactly why when people are young like this is what he said i don't know if it's true or not this is why when people are young girls tend to like bad guys more because they know that they can handle themselves you know how everyone says nice guys don't get girlfriends or like,2,712.532,749.627,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_17,he said i don't know if it's true or not this is why when people are young girls tend to like bad guys more because they know that they can handle themselves you know how everyone says nice guys don't get girlfriends or like so this is the basic of it that they are monsters now but then they will eventually grow up being mature and we realize that i am hurting too many people i shouldn't do but tomorrow if they are thrown into an uncomfortable situation they'll handle themselves because they have been monsters before but if you're always a nice guy even in a bad situation you'll end up being a nice guy and someone will walk all over you,1,736.733,773.712,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_17,why when people are young girls tend to like bad guys more because they know that they can handle themselves you know how everyone says nice guys don't get girlfriends or like so this is the basic of it that they are monsters now but then they will eventually grow up being mature and we realize that i am hurting too many people i shouldn't do but tomorrow if they are thrown into an uncomfortable,0,738.758,761.759,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_18,yeah right i mean they always say that,0,777.499,779.932,1

UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_20,no it's fine i like that example like send in the war or warrior in the garden so it was nice but i was i i think,0,796.746,810.899,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_20,so sorry no it's fine i like that example like send in the war or warrior in the garden so it was nice but i was i i think asking you uh what do you think like being sarcastic is uh too bad or it's just fine sometimes because i think it's humorous too i mean it's not just bad everyone cannot be sarcastic because i think that is also like i said sarcasm is a good tool right,1,796.927,828.658,1
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_21,someone's leg on a very minor thing then it's completely fine friends do it all the time it's a great way to communicate to put your opinions out in the world but if you're doing this to put someone down to make them feel bad about themselves then obviously it becomes very toxic it's a very unhealthy way to communicate,0,836.87,854.072,0

UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_22,when someone taunts i just walk away i finish the conversation and just walk away because i know that person doesn't want to solve anything they just want to vent or they just want to,0,865.21,872.307,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_1_22,doesn't want to solve anything they just want to vent or they just want to get married so i know if there's no scope of improvement then there's no time i'm not going to waste my time on this conversation it's a little extreme i know but i'm just letting you know this is what i do,1,869.536,883.566,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_2_17,yeah i mean i think sometimes you can just handle it or you can just respond in a way so that other person would feel that i think i'm just wasting time on this person and you should not react like positively to that person like,2,883.926,900.915,0
UlukOsT0gto,UlukOsT0gto_0_23,mean i think sometimes you can just handle it or you can just respond,0,884.647,888.934,1

UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_0_13,we mostly have a normal,0,137.642,139.066,1

UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_2_1,okay great and all of your classes are fifteen minutes right,2,165.436,170.183,1
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_0_16,classes are fifteen minutes right so you don't learn anything in particular,0,166.978,173.668,0
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_1_16,anything in particular you just chat,1,173.247,175.01,0
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_1_17,okay so do you have any questions about english that you find like difficult to understand or like parts of english i guess you could say,1,178.332,186.889,0
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_0_17,so do you have any questions about english that you find like difficult to understand or like parts of english,0,178.552,186.047,0
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_0_18,and speaking are a good part but sometimes they have confusions like how do native speakers,0,196.946,202.414,1
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_1_18,native speakers use such good vocabulary i mean they get stuck sometimes while using so can you please say something about that,1,201.312,208.991,1
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_1_19,a different function which would be an adverb where it's beautifully right so an adjective describes a noun and an adverb describes a uh it describes a verb yes but we can then change the same meaning to a verb we can say for example where it becomes an action to make something beautiful and we can have it which is a person who works in the beauty industry and then we have beauty which is an idea so having the ability to do this kind of like let's say function training i guess you could call it you will smooth out your your speech significantly you will increase understanding speaking and your grammar all at the same time just doing i guess this exercise it's not that hard it only takes like two minutes i'm sorry you how to use study vocabulary for example,1,246.46,306.478,0
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_0_19,of like let's say function training i guess you could call,0,277.044,281.578,0
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_0_20,to use simple normal vocabulary and i guess my vocabulary improves while reading i read a lot of english novels so that helps a lot like sometimes you know i probably don't know a meaning of the word but when i,0,312.465,324.957,1
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_1_20,i read a lot of english novels so that helps a lot like sometimes you know i probably don't know a meaning of the word but when i read it when i read it for a lot of times probably continuously i'm reading the word and then i get to know the meaning just like that and then i normally it happens like i might use it in a sentence while i'm speaking,1,317.476,340.851,1
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_2_2,yeah so this is a very interesting thing that you mentioned because like yes there's a lot of vocabularies in english and every type of language actually but only the ones that we use to speak is a small amount so targeting these languages or these vocabularies would be a good idea to start you know simple words like they them you i we also is am are was were these are vocabularies that are in every single sentence depending on what you're talking about but they come across so frequently that if you know how to structure them correctly you're almost there you're almost there but,2,342.386,379.911,1
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_0_21,we use to speak is a small amount so targeting these languages or these vocabularies would be a good idea to start you,0,352.885,361.11,0
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_1_21,were these are vocabularies that are in every single sentence depending on what you're talking about but they come across so frequently that if you know how to structure them correctly you're almost there you're almost there but reading let's talk about that what do you read novels,1,367.22,383.995,0
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_0_22,genre i love reading agatha christie,0,397.035,399.182,1
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_1_22,few novels like i guess mystery would be my favorite genre,1,402.57,407.526,1
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_0_23,interesting interesting okay so give me one,0,408.814,412.48,0

UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_0_24,a mystery novel that i just frequently bought and i haven't completed that yet but it might be good,0,418.818,425.773,1
UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_1_24,it would be good i have like finished it half but then i guess it would be a good one,1,431.259,436.145,1

UwkpF-oTLrs,UwkpF-oTLrs_2_5,but it is very technical though like certain books have certain vocabularies that go with it but like fantasy novels i've actually read a book called lullaby by little criminals lullabies by little criminals i don't remember exactly who wrote that book but,2,507.83,524.961,1

akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_2_7,yeah so i am i am from london i also live in london at the moment i've not always lived in london but i i'm at a friend's house at the moment so it's a different vibe this is not my usual background but i am twenty seven years old and to be honest i just went traveling by myself for the first time this year so that was a new experience for me i have spent most of my time i have spent all my time living in the uk so i understand how it feels i've traveled around the uk like quite a bit but i'm considering traveling a bit more in my free time i like to read i've started writing and kind of i don't know becoming more in tune with the arts like writing and drawing and kind of so i really enjoy that but i don't i have never really tried audio books it might be a good way to just kind of relax at night but i quite like the fact that you can tire yourself out by reading so after being on the computer all day it's nice to kind of sit back and read but,2,277.239,345.873,1
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_0_21,twenty seven years old and to be honest i just went traveling by myself for the first time this year so that was a new experience for me i have spent most of my time i have spent all my time living in the uk so i understand how it feels i've traveled around the uk like quite a bit but i'm considering traveling a bit more in my free time i like to read i've started writing and kind of i don't know becoming more in tune with the arts like writing and drawing and kind of so i really enjoy that but i don't i have never really tried audio books it might be a good way to just kind of relax at night but i quite like the fact that you can tire yourself out by reading,0,292.789,339.12,0
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_1_21,and kind of i don't know becoming more in tune with the arts like writing and drawing and kind of so i really enjoy that but i don't i have never really tried audio books it might be a good way to just kind of relax at night but i quite like the fact that you can tire yourself out by reading so after being on the computer all day it's nice to kind of sit back and read but i recently started doing this kind of conversational english but i'm really enjoying it i have to say you meet so many people from a variety of countries and their interesting cultures that i i don't know i want to take it further so i'm trying to do i have a mathematics degree so i'm going to maybe start tutoring mathematics on the side as well because i really enjoy helping people,1,319.859,368.799,0
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_0_22,a mathematics degree very interesting,0,370.714,372.479,1
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_1_22,i have been good at mathematics so let me just have a few questions no no no,1,373.501,377.512,1
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_1_23,well i mean you can but like yes it might be a good start to actually get questioned on it before i start tutoring,1,379.892,385.825,0
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_0_23,i mean you can but,0,380.052,380.874,0
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_0_24,girls you know and especially from like england or usa who have done something in mathematics right,0,388.649,395.595,1
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_1_24,england or usa who have done something in mathematics right so i have done something in business management literature but i have found uh like very rare people have been done something in mathematics so what made you interested in mathematics,1,391.531,408.148,1
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_2_8,i think i've always liked the fact that it's either right or wrong there might be some few ways of going about proving something but it's either it's a yes or a no there's no kind of middle ground it's like the black and white of mathematics and when i was younger so i kind of pursued that path but now i like it a bit less i don't like it as much as i did when i was younger but,2,409.738,438.15,1
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_1_25,and white of mathematics and when i was younger so i kind of pursued that path but now i like it a bit less i don't like it as much as i did when i was younger but it happened,1,422.625,439.433,0
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_0_25,when i was younger so i kind of pursued that path but now i like it a bit less i don't like it as much as i did when i was younger,0,424.447,436.266,0
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_0_26,i think it happens with,0,440.415,441.699,1
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_1_26,of life so now you are not uh like as much concentrated as you were before right so it happens like for example i was very in tuned with chemistry when i was in high school right but later on i started growing up i i pursued my chemistry because it was the a most interesting subject for me but after all i felt like i'm not as interested as i was before so literally just start fading away right now yes i'm a teacher i'm still interested in it but that creativity is not in my mind that was,1,450.899,491.784,1
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_2_9,while i was in high school days or in intermediate right so,2,492.245,496.087,1
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_0_27,in high school days or in,0,492.805,494.166,0
akXknJMVLIs,akXknJMVLIs_1_27,i don't know exams and help them feel more confident in themselves then i'll probably start tutoring like a level potentially higher but i think if i start at that level it'd be nice to like start to kind of get back into it and into the swing of things because i've not i graduated what six years ago now six years ago,1,533.688,552.258,0

bbBMPIYlbGk,bbBMPIYlbGk_1_26,are going to enjoy once you are stepping into a new thing it is really fantastic you will have to put up more efforts you will have to learn new things because when you are going to be in the same field for the long time it is going to be monotonous but i feel,1,540.053,552.28,0
bbBMPIYlbGk,bbBMPIYlbGk_0_26,in the same field for the long time it is going to be monotonous but,0,548.673,551.9,0

iv2_IBcW8tE,iv2_IBcW8tE_1_67,english is subject verb object but in korean it's subject object verb right,1,667.893,675.02,1
iv2_IBcW8tE,iv2_IBcW8tE_1_68,yeah yeah so for example like in english we say i walk to the park but in korean you would say i park and walking to,1,678.225,690.795,1
iv2_IBcW8tE,iv2_IBcW8tE_0_68,yeah so for example like in english we say i walk to the park but in korean you,0,678.765,688.593,1
iv2_IBcW8tE,iv2_IBcW8tE_2_33,yeah like in park and walking too,2,692.781,695.062,1

kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_0_18,didn't look at the questions,0,210.935,212.158,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_1_18,look at the questions properly but i just saw the title it was dreams,1,211.216,214.763,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_0_19,dreams yes so should we begin with,0,215.504,218.631,0
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_1_19,should we begin with it yes all right so can you tell me what are dreams firstly explain firstly define what is a dream,1,217.869,227.323,0
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_0_20,we think and that like happens,0,231.153,233.296,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_1_20,thinking and that comes to reality in our dreams,1,249.34,252.488,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_2_6,okay you can't really say that they are not reality so you can we see or things that we feel like we're experiencing in dreams,2,253.363,263.646,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_0_21,you can't really say that,0,253.524,254.887,0
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_2_7,okay don't use the word reality because it's complete opposite of that right so although i get what you're trying to say but i don't think it would be good to use that word so say that you know the things that you see or you feel like you're experiencing while you're sleeping are called dreams there is another meaning as well do you know yes yes means aim ambition exactly yes something that you want to do in your future and you want to see yourself become right so yes that is also another meaning of dream but here we are definitely going to talk about what you spoke about first and that is what we see uh why we sleep,2,263.426,308.135,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_1_21,talk about what you spoke about first and that is what we see uh why we sleep so these were the definitions but if i have to ask you what do uh what what do dreams mean to you,1,301.461,317.962,0

kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_0_22,just wake up in the middle of the,0,331.708,333.312,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_1_22,so crazy and i have really stupid dreams all the time so well i would not say like it means like it is inspirational to me or something like that but i go through an interesting time while dreaming,1,337.461,349.415,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_0_23,okay if given a chance would you want to go back to those dreams or,0,351.7,358.092,0

kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_1_26,just the five minutes the first five minutes i wake up and then i forget about it completely,1,389.683,394.275,1

kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_0_44,are left and i have,0,757.872,758.633,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_2_15,sometimes dreams are so unexplainable like you can't understand what's going on,2,767.31,776.728,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_2_16,yeah i don't know why but i have seen similar dreams like that has been with me as well sometimes i woke up so late and i realized that,2,776.567,784.768,1

kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_1_45,me as well sometimes i woke up so late and i realized that time is almost over and then,1,781.16,786.792,0
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_2_17,you would just start doing it and then,2,787.659,789.928,0
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_0_46,then and you know um i have really this type of dreams like suppose i'm trying to get ready in the morning for school i have to wake up really early and i have dreamt like when i was sleeping i have dreamt that i've already,0,789.306,802.504,1

kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_1_47,question was going to be is there any dream that you have seen repeatedly,1,821.075,825.602,0
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_0_47,any dream that you have seen repeatedly,0,823.178,825.602,0
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_1_48,repetently no many have those dreams that they continue like a series but i haven't i have never seen those type of dreams that you know that i was seeing all the time so so like you said you have had this dream of,1,827.405,842.741,1

kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_2_18,you know you are getting ready and you're waiting and then suddenly you wake up and you realize that you know you have not not done any of it and it was all a dream so if that has happened a lot of times then it is repetition right the dream was repeated so then you can say that yes this is one of those dreams which was repeated,2,843.141,862.688,1
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_0_49,know you have not not done any of it and it was all a dream so if that has happened a lot of times then it is repetition right the dream was repeated so then you can say that yes this is one of those dreams which was repeated we're connected when i'm saying is there any dream you have had repeatedly so then that means,0,849.513,870.995,0
kAU0_qvLUVw,kAU0_qvLUVw_1_49,is repetition right the dream was repeated so then you can say that yes this is one of those dreams which was repeated we're connected when i'm saying is there any dream you have had repeatedly so then that means it's the same dream happening again and again,1,856.242,874.18,0

rlV9y1jKevQ,rlV9y1jKevQ_2_17,yeah it depends on context so same same can happen with english the word forward you can say it in a march past and it means different but you can say it while watching a movie and it means different you want to forward the movie not yourself so that's what context so that's why you take the entire sentence down and then ten minutes a day that is before you sleep or after you get up choose the time that your brain function is less than normal,2,818.736,845.135,1
rlV9y1jKevQ,rlV9y1jKevQ_0_40,time that your brain function is less than normal so that way you're challenging yourself then you stand in front of a mirror and say all those sentences that you've noted down seven times out loud and to challenge yourself since you are at the intermediate level you can obviously create your own sentences with words first three times you're saying it just how you noted it fourth fifth sixth and seventh you change up the sentence every time so now you're challenging yourself and then you're also teaching your mouth how to say it many times at this stage many people make this mistake of just learning words but,0,841.588,879.613,0
rlV9y1jKevQ,rlV9y1jKevQ_1_40,obviously create your own sentences with words first three times you're saying it just how you noted it fourth fifth sixth and seventh you change up the sentence every time so now you're challenging yourself and then you're also teaching your mouth how to say it many times at this stage many people make this mistake of just learning words but just learning words won't help you to remember it again or use it again it's just like memorizing the periodic table you know all the elements you don't know why they are there for the certain reason why is hydrogen up there always compared to mentally being down here until you understand why are they non-metals why are these alkaline earth metals why are they non-alkaline earth metals why are they radioactive materials until you understand that how the periodic table was created you won't understand chemistry in itself,1,858.507,910.613,0

rlV9y1jKevQ,rlV9y1jKevQ_1_43,do that is songs actually not even kidding you so how do you want to switch first is to find that neutral accent if you want i can pull off an american accent better than most people in this nation but i don't do that i don't know that even though my mom and i are both trained in american accent,1,978.047,998.001,0

rlV9y1jKevQ,rlV9y1jKevQ_1_45,british you know be it russian doesn't matter doesn't matter we like vodka so any accent once you find this base no accent is difficult for you you can pull off any one of them with enough practice given so that's the thing so when it comes to american with your errors what you see is you're not i cannot feel that air coming out of your mouth when you speak american your mouth should be wide as wide as possible but at the same time there should be air coming out like the way we trained for abcd in american was when i said a we had a paper in front of my mouth and that paper should move a b c that every word had to move that paper it had to wiggle and that's how you speak in american accent so that's the practice for you if you want to perfect the accent do this if you find a neutral sense listen to songs and sing along,1,1050.597,1114.059,0

sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_0_3,my name is sapna and i am from jammu as far as my academic credentials are concerned i have done masters in english and i have a ba degree too right now i am a full-time homemaker and blessed with the one kid and uh i also want to improve my communication skills that's why i'm connecting to you i want to improve my communication skills for my village students as well as for me because i have master's degree and i want to justify with my degree and with my son so that's all about,0,66.887,104.205,0

sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_1_4,language as a mode of communication it is really a skill so this is a different thing,1,175.206,180.275,1
sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_0_5,think this thing it may be the mentality of this another person that if you have a master's degree it may be you are competent or you can confidently speak this language especially if we talk about the english subject if you have a degree with history or another thing it may be the perception of the people a little bit different but if you have a master's degree it may or a hundred percent the perception of the people is that that you are confident in writing and speaking and whatever,0,187.525,222.609,0

sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_0_6,is the skill so that is nothing to do with the credentials and the same rule applies over here like though we have studied this language during our school or college days but and you did your masters so people are right at their way because they assume you are educated and you should have the answers to all of their queries and so far as this language is concerned they can never imagine that you can't understand you can't speak the thing is when we listen uh we get the time we are not answerable to anybody that out of a hundred percent content how much i could understand when we are writing again the ball is in our court similar thing happens when we are reading but when we are speaking there is no retake and speaking is performing in some other body's presence like it is a kind of stage performance and people used to have this stage fear always in their mind because though we believe it is not a performance but in spite of it when we do something in public where immediately you are judged though we believe we shouldn't be judged we have no right to judge it so yes we are on the same page this problem exists everywhere around that initially we are hesitant we don't find the words right words don't come to,0,346.026,436.638,1
sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_1_6,stage fear always in their mind because though we believe it is not a performance but in spite of it when we do something in public where immediately you are judged though we believe we shouldn't be judged we have no right to judge it so yes we are on the same page this problem exists everywhere around that initially we are hesitant we don't find the words right words don't come to the minds at the right time and the main answer to all of these issues is more you speak more you learn and more you become the best version of yourself so that's why we people are here on this platform,1,405.188,450.708,1

sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_1_9,boon that we have got the chance to converse this way and we can work on our communication skills we can here are thought processes also and this way what i have started exploring out of these conversations is it's not only the language you get to know about the mindset of the people living in different you young moms like you who hail from villages and you people are so keen to to learn this language not for your family of course for your family for your children but you want to serve the society also and that way you people really portray very good example you are going to set example for the all the women of the of the society i must say so beautiful beautiful,1,650.857,704.77,1

sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_1_13,subject or their main focus is simply up to the clearance of the examination only they teach you simple very basic things like they don't make you understand they they fail to develop the love for their own subject which is their subject so definitely there was something wrong with the kind of system the way we were being taught during our school or college days so nothing wrong with us but now if we have started working on it and we have realized like in your case you want to become a tutor in this subject and hats off to you that you are not going to repeat the history of your teacher might be that her own funders were not clear but before you land up on that platform you want to make yourself ready for that good thing about you this shows that how much passion you have for this language and moreover this shows that you value the time and the money or and the other investments people do when some students they are coming to you and if you are a teacher they believe into you to that much extent that they believe in every word whatever comes out of your mind and now when you are thinking of you can say stepping into their shoes you are getting ready for that in a real sense because you are aware of the situation that if the teacher is not well prepared or teacher is not well informed or teacher is not passionate what kind of students the teacher is going to produce like you and me who might suffer after five years ten years or twenty years in their life so we are not to produce those kinds of students so that's why i really appreciate your approach that you are preparing yourself to step into the shoes of an english teacher or english mentor,1,941.685,1066.265,1
sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_0_14,of this march and he sent his son to me for teaching and when i took his english subject and asked him about their subject and content even though the student didn't know the syllabus what would come in their exam because then the same question i asked from one of my friends she is now in a private institution where i did work before my marriage i asked the syllabus from him when i compare the things,0,1090.551,1128.361,0
sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_1_14,who are presenting school don't know what would come in their exam even though syllabus they don't know so i was really shocked what you are doing what your teacher is doing in the school but because i can't say anything to that person i don't know their mentality or their teaching method i don't know much about the other but the situations are same because maybe you leave the city you may not meet the person who belongs to the village right now but when i observe the things around me the situation i have faced when i was in my school days the same situation students are facing right now and these things hurt me a lot,1,1134.285,1185.173,0
sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_0_15,two or three or five months you people are going to sit for the exam and this is the content which you are going to study during this period this is your syllabus so but at our times what this syllabus was what this we were not familiar with this word even we got to know about it later so that was the responsibility of the teachers it means our education system is not on the right track it really needs to be worked on it really needs to be overhauled because teachers are the you can say uh not only the i can say future makers they are the builders of everything of the nation we call the teacher builder of the nation this is the reason because doctors engineers and these you can say even you can include the politicians as well because it is all the mindset which the teacher when she talks to the students he talks to the students you try to bring the best out of the child so it's not only that every student is going to become a teacher may become a teacher may become an engineer or doctor or become an ips or ias officer,0,1261.595,1339.016,1
sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_1_15,can include the politicians as well because it is all the mindset which the teacher when she talks to the students he talks to the students you try to bring the best out of the child so it's not only that every student is going to become a teacher may become a teacher may become an engineer or doctor or become an ips or ias officer this list is unending so what i want to conclude is it is all in the hands of that sculpture and teacher plays that role teacher has to shape the minds of the students and the rest of the future that whole trajectory is laid down at that very moment that what a student is going to become in the next ten years or the twenty years so but i think in the schools an orientation session is needed in the beginning of the session there should be some orientation session done where teachers should be made aware of all these things and they should be taught about the teaching methods you said you have done weird i think i heard something of that i think something that sort of training is given during that when you go for that degree because to work in a school i think every teacher needs to have this degree in education now you are the right person who can throw some light on it whether these teaching methods are taught during this degree when you go for this study or this attaining ba degree is also like attaining other degrees as well,1,1315.981,1420.329,1
sYqnnRAv-64,sYqnnRAv-64_0_16,even teaching in this process you can use activity methods so many methods storytelling methods the purpose of this degree to indulge the student and as a teacher is the responsibility to give your best to your student in any way it doesn't mean that you have to use the method through which we have studied just like the teacher only taught the student and the student crammed the things not like that in this degree there are so many ways talk to the,0,1434.297,1468.569,0
