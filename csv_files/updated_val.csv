4Ng6b2VxEV8,4Ng6b2VxEV8_2_12,not a single topic or something i can talk anything so that's the thing and second thing is what they are able to relate because i had started my journey and they are able to see my videos how i was two or three years ago right so that's so but when they see a teacher they see like he's already brilliant he was born when they talk to somebody like when they see a trainer from bengaluru from chennai mumbai they feel they are in that environment because they went to such a great school where they had a great luxury,2,778.832,811.476,0
4Ng6b2VxEV8,4Ng6b2VxEV8_2_13,okay to talk in english but when i say about myself that i am from kanpur they have i was born and raised here but learned it and i see that it's practical so that's why they engage more and if i'll give you an example are you am i clear to you yes yes you are please continue so what i was telling you that the people they relate more to the background,2,811.256,835.253,0
4Ng6b2VxEV8,4Ng6b2VxEV8_0_39,myself that i am from kanpur they have i was born and raised here but learned it and i see that it's practical so that's why they engage more and if i'll give you an example are you am i clear to you yes yes you are please continue so what i,0,814.041,831.75,1
4Ng6b2VxEV8,4Ng6b2VxEV8_1_39,why because she came from a very normal background a lady with a sorry and she speaks english,1,866.843,874.066,1

4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_2_37,it is completely different actually,2,1136.613,1138.596,1
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_2_38,yeah physical learning is how it's different experience and online learning i know that thrill that excitement is not there in online learning they are missing it and also uh they don't understand concepts also,2,1139.864,1161.484,1
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_0_60,is how it's different experience and online learning i know that thrill that excitement is not there in,0,1140.246,1150.879,0
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_1_60,actually physical learning is how it's different experience and online learning i know that thrill that excitement is not there in online learning they are missing it and also uh they don't understand concepts also when when we were in the classroom teacher used to scare us or somehow they used to teach us what they are trying to teach but in online they don't have that much control over us yes so i think there are this is the difference,1,1140.246,1185.233,0
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_2_39,don't you think that's a little better because you know when i was in school um i'm talking about early like from fifth standard to eighth standard,2,1186.552,1196.164,0
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_1_61,know when i was in school um i'm talking about early like from fifth standard to eighth standard there were teachers and they would take rulers and hit you in the hand,1,1189.422,1199.835,1

4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_2_40,yeah so i think now it's better because now teachers are not allowed to do these things the rules are much more strict and they have to focus on their skills on how to get through to the kid how do i make this kid interested in the topic how do i make sure the kid remembers or understands the topic right it's not just slap the kid and tell him why don't you learn this go learn this you know so,2,1202.804,1229.346,0

4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_0_64,let's say someone tells us this is how,0,1239.966,1241.83,1
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_1_64,check in a bank that's how good that's what we're going to teach our kids or our younger brothers and sisters,1,1242.311,1248.268,1

4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_1_65,what they already don't know,1,1254.771,1255.915,0
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_0_66,what are the advantages and disadvantages of online learning and something that can be found in like physical school,0,1260.205,1267.939,1

4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_1_68,but we cannot do that in online,1,1313.934,1316.503,0
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_2_43,yes there are advantages and disadvantages for that as well because you can spend more time with your family when you're eating lunch right but that means that your social skills will not develop that much because you're not around thirty kids they can't bully you i'm not saying bullying is good but we have to understand that is how life prepares us yes because if you don't get bullied in school you can't handle bullies in real life people who try to take advantage of you people who have bad intentions right yes it kind of develops this sixth sense,2,1317.492,1356.598,0
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_0_69,not develop that much because you're not around thirty kids they can't bully you i'm not saying bullying is good,0,1329.724,1337.88,1
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_1_69,not develop that much because you're not around thirty kids they can't bully you i'm not saying bullying is good but we have to understand that is how life prepares us yes because if you don't get bullied in school you can't handle bullies in real life people who try to take advantage of you people who have bad intentions right yes it kind of develops this sixth sense wait what is this person trying to say what is this person trying to do they trying to take advantage of my money or of my you know position like let's say you work in the government or you work in any other organization right so it becomes very obvious that these skills at least i'm scared that these skills are going to be lacking in the new generation that is coming up i'm sure they are socializing on you know social media they're getting together on a lot of online games there are substitutes but i think nothing beats that thing that's true what about you what are you scared of the most for the next generation or excited also scared or excited for the next generation i mean these kids who are passing out through online school kids who are missing out on college because of online college,1,1330.285,1408.223,1
4oMTIac9hcU,4oMTIac9hcU_2_44,oh wait what is this person trying to say what is this person trying to do they trying to take advantage of my money or of my you know position like let's say you work in the government or you work in any other organization right so it becomes very obvious that these skills at least i'm scared that these skills are going to be lacking in the new generation that is coming up i'm sure they are socializing on you know social media they're getting together on a lot of online games there are substitutes but i think nothing beats that thing,2,1356.498,1391.361,0

6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_1_34,to call us do do they actually talk about politics with you because that's kind of strange right,1,458.452,465.195,1

6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_0_39,see so for example maybe when you meet,0,552.517,554.681,0
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_2_29,yeah i try to but i don't like it either,2,561.201,563.746,1
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_1_39,you can be easy or you can also be difficult sure,1,567.374,572.024,0
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_1_40,united states politics always finds a way into the conversation you know like one moment you're talking about the nba you're talking about basketball but then somehow you're talking about politics and you're like what what's happening i thought we were talking about basketball,1,575.095,592.685,1

6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_2_31,yeah actually i i don't think we talk about maybe if we just talk about basketball then we'll keep going talking about basketball and we'll finish the you know conversation but well i guess,2,601.417,613.437,1
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_2_32,yeah they like to talk about politics that's why maybe,2,613.216,616.7,1
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_2_33,yeah while they were talking about something far away from politics and then yes sometimes they're talking about politics well,2,616.5,625.088,1
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_1_41,talking about something far away from politics and then yes sometimes they're talking about politics well that is really interesting by the way is politics that popular in,1,618.061,629.132,0
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_0_42,it's very boring so like let's say,0,632.662,635.29,1
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_1_42,like let's say uh let's take who's the first basketball player you think of when i say basketball player,1,634.167,643.146,1

6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_1_44,parents don't have a lot of money he tries to make sure that they're good in education they can eat they can go to school things they need to develop but then lebron he also he also tries to stand for black justice right he wants he wants like he wants the police to not hit or kill black people right so this is actually more of a political topic,1,670.923,702.028,1
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_0_44,develop but then lebron he also he also tries to stand for,0,680.863,689.082,1
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_2_35,yeah oh wow i see that's how the conversation goes,2,702.589,705.756,1
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_2_36,yeah that is really cool i i think i also talk about you know something uh far away from politics and,2,705.796,712.409,1

6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_0_45,he likes to help poor and he likes to donate his money to charity and you know that is something about it that is more like the politics so,0,717.156,728.058,0
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_1_45,to help poor and he likes to donate his money to charity and you know that is something about it that is more like the politics so yeah,1,721.645,730.302,0

6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_0_48,yeah that's right so it,0,801.098,802.642,0
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_1_48,yeah that's right so it goes together,1,801.098,803.364,0
6GX_K-tv-xg,6GX_K-tv-xg_0_49,it kind of has to,0,804.728,806.172,1

7pfzGEUTVqE,7pfzGEUTVqE_2_13,a very subjective opinion but i don't get into these things quite often so i have not developed an opinion in that area but,2,640.134,649.337,0
7pfzGEUTVqE,7pfzGEUTVqE_2_14,yeah obviously there obviously there is an attraction to between two people or two things that is why i don't believe in that concept which is becoming really famous that is advaith there are second things also it's not just you not everything is inside you there are different humans who hold even better things who hold even better creativity that is why it is said humans are not islands they have to communicate with each other to know to know this world better not just to know that other person better because it's important to communicate and for that you need two people obviously so yes attraction is up between a son and a mother you can see between two people who are deeply in love with each other and you can see it among two siblings you can see it among two cricket players also that is there so that attraction is always there only then this world has remained how it has always remained and only then we have more population obviously that's also there so,2,649.056,703.546,0

9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_14,lights and then he started,0,268.693,270.88,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_14,on all the lights and then he started looking into around what was he doing yes purposely because the sound was coming from radio from the radio so he was looking in the radio he was looking at the radio he was looking at the radio trying to find the source of the sound yes,1,268.693,288.771,1

9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_2_10,okay so he was looking in the radio he was looking at the radio,2,280.361,284.606,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_15,that there was a small old wooden,0,292.791,298.522,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_15,wall and the radio was placed on it placed on that wooden plank yes and in that wooden plank there was a small hole and sound was still coming so we found that the sound was coming from that hole so we took a small thin wooden stick and scratching scratching yes we started scratching there isn't it,1,304.477,345.114,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_16,know what you did so i can't correct you,0,347.242,349.187,1

9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_17,into the hole to see what was,0,358.186,359.909,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_17,to see what was in there,1,358.707,360.29,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_2_11,we started digging into the hole to see what was there what is there what was in there what was in there yes so there was some insects in that hole and the voice was it one set or like plural singular or plural plural plural there were some insects,2,360.972,386.395,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_18,hole to see what was there what is there what was in there what was in there,0,363.317,370.287,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_18,is there what was in there what was in there yes so there was some insects in that hole and the voice was it one set or like plural singular or plural plural plural there were some insects yes there were some insects and the sound or the voice,1,367.183,391.709,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_19,i think the voice is for humans,0,391.99,394.834,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_19,i think the voice is for humans,1,391.99,394.834,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_20,okay so the sound was coming from them,1,395.536,399.342,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_20,so the sound was coming from,0,397.238,399.081,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_21,was talking in which case that is very scary was the insect talking to you no but i feel that insect is also,1,401.873,410.127,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_21,was the insect talking to you,0,405.098,406.3,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_22,beings yes living beings yes but they don't see the thing,0,415.634,419.577,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_22,see the thing about voice is,1,418.757,420.358,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_23,make noise by rubbing their wings together sometimes they make noise by rubbing their hands together like beetles do that uh grasshoppers make noise by rubbing their back or something like that i'm not really sure right,0,429.449,442.153,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_23,hands together like beetles do that uh grasshoppers make noise by rubbing their back or something like that i'm not really sure right so we can't really say that it's a voice now the reason why we say frogs croak right because frogs don't talk only noise you hear is when they make that thing they croak basically they breathe in and they breathe out like from their throat right and we hear the vibrations we hear the i don't know i'm not going to make that noise,1,433.918,469.771,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_24,need to say sound from frog,1,473.237,475.061,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_24,to say sound from frog,0,473.398,475.061,0

9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_26,but if someone don't know what,0,482.125,484.466,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_26,is the exactly word of frog sound and in a general way anybody want to talk like,1,484.526,491.35,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_27,coming from the frog you can say that the frog is making some noise the frog is being loud you can say a lot of things honestly because that is the magic of english the vocabulary is so vast you can say the same sentence in,0,493.567,509.605,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_27,sentence in ten different ways right,1,509.124,511.287,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_28,magic for you but for us it is i know i,0,514.472,517.005,0

9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_29,we are here to explain it to you that it can work,0,519.768,522.371,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_29,can work in that way yes yes,1,522.071,523.032,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_30,that was a story and we finally we found the reason behind that sound and uh i i said at that time like um i breath with a relief um,1,527.097,543.899,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_30,reason behind that sound and uh i i said at that time like um i breath,0,532.209,540.733,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_31,i took a sigh of relief or i took a breath breath,1,545.058,549.627,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_31,took a sigh of relief or,0,545.259,546.722,1

9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_33,translating from hindi to english again it has nothing to do with breathing it has to be a sigh of relief i took a sigh of relief or i was so relieved,1,553.998,563.444,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_33,again it has nothing to do with breathing,0,555.642,559.071,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_34,i took a sigh of relief,0,564.225,565.567,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_34,i took a sigh of relief,1,564.225,565.567,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_35,yeah or i was so,0,567.649,568.37,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_35,or i was so relieved,1,567.93,568.711,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_36,some sound when we hear some sound and we don't even try to find out behind the reason the reason behind it the reason behind,1,582.426,597.477,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_36,hear some sound and we don't even try to find out behind the reason the reason behind it the reason,0,584.09,597.076,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_37,okay so this was the,0,600.087,607.116,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_37,okay so this was the horrible story for me at that time but now i,1,600.087,612.407,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_2_12,it was a scary story for me but now when i we call it i laugh at it,2,613.763,626.418,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_38,good word you can use over here you can say that um this was a scary,0,627.28,631.658,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_38,once i debunked it it became funny so debunked yes debunked basically means to find the source of something,1,633.681,645.81,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_2_13,okay so let's say someone says,2,645.87,648.333,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_39,say someone says don't go,0,646.29,648.333,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_39,into that house it's haunted,1,648.673,649.775,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_2_14,because we keep hearing sounds or we keep hearing glass breaking or we keep hearing people screaming right yes so i'll come and say you know that's i'm just gonna go check it you guys are just being paranoid you guys are just being you guys are just scared that's why you're not going to check it i'm going to go debunking debunk basically means trying to find the origin or the reason behind something so you thought it was coming from the radio,2,651.497,679.702,0

9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_2_15,yeah debunk b-e-b-u-n-k d-e-b-u-n-k yes so uh i can say that i've debunked the mystery that means i've solved the mystery i have the source of the sound but i have the reason behind whatever is happening when you look at any paranormal movies anything that's scary they always try to say that did anyone debunk that mystery,2,679.401,714.413,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_40,sound but i have the reason behind whatever is happening when you look at any paranormal movies anything that's scary they always try to say that did anyone debunk that mystery did anyone solve it did anyone find out the actual reason behind it now glass can be breaking because the windows open and the wind keeps know moving the window and the glass keeps breaking um noises like you said like you've experienced can be from anywhere it can be from an insect it can be from a broken plank where you know a stream of um like the sound of wind whistling so there are times where what is whistling when you just keep your lips together and you blow right,1,700.114,744.974,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_41,when there is a small,0,748.912,750.315,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_41,crevice or a gap in a window there's only a small gap in the window and there's wind trying to go through it,1,752.539,758.291,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_2_16,it might whistle right so people might think,2,758.833,761.92,0
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_0_42,god someone's whistling and then you might get scared someone has to debunk it by saying just open the window,0,761.94,767.048,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_42,you will know that there is no whistling it's just the wind trying to make trying to get out or making a noise that is what how we debunk a situation okay okay,1,767.348,778.873,1
9DgrUS_Uqz0,9DgrUS_Uqz0_1_43,like in all this story i uh i i get stuck somewhere one place like i want to say i thought at that time i thought that radio is all because i was thinking at that time what will i think that the radio is off so how should i speak the radio is on,1,780.982,802.772,0

9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_1_18,want to keep with myself that everyone loves is all the teachers are always praising my behavior my polite behavior i don't know if i'm polite but yes for them i am polite so i would like to keep that cousin i respect my teachers a lot so that is one the thing that i would love to keep because i think a lot of students of my age they don't behave nicely with the teachers so i'd like to keep that and the thing that i'd like to get rid of will be i get distracted a lot by anything like when i'm trying to study i get distracted by just little bit of things and i just go into that imaginary world and i have lost track of my studies so i get distracted a lot so i think i would like to change this habit of mine i'd like to focus i cannot focus properly,1,380.823,430.666,1
9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_0_18,a lot so that is one the thing that i would love to keep because i think a lot of students of,0,394.985,400.516,1

9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_1_20,or whatever happens in school and maybe some kind of movies or some kind of books that i have read so all those stories goes in my mind of school especially the main thing is of school and that only what distracts me anything except studies i always think about that and when i'm trying to study i just cannot,1,461.401,482.661,1
9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_0_20,main thing is of school and,0,471.609,473.551,1

9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_2_5,yes the first thing that i'd like to change about is giving lots of homework like we get so many homework,2,543.338,551.648,0
9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_0_24,cannot do anything else at home like if you want to study something else then we cannot do and we have to stick to the homework so giving homework is nice but giving lots of homework is not at all good so trying to do that is probably my first thing as a principal and then discipline i like to make,0,553.749,575.83,1
9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_1_24,good so trying to do that is probably my first thing as a principal and then discipline i like to make it like you know the students should not fear the teachers but still they should respect them that is what i want to make sure that the students follow they should not fear of course fear i don't like this concept of students clearing the teachers but i think some strict rules should be there that they would follow and the discipline would be there yes these are some,1,565.208,599.295,1

9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_1_29,not easy and i'm telling you because i have been an administrator for a very renowned school i do know that and so so how would you go about it i mean you're saying just remove them so how would you how would you go about getting a teacher a good teacher and how would you ensure adrija can i add that question how would you ensure that that teacher you are bringing into the school would not be a similar kind for which you have removed that teacher i hope you understood,1,645.955,679.164,0
9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_0_29,know that and so so how would you go about it i mean you're saying just remove them so how would you how would you go about getting a teacher a good teacher and how would,0,653.875,666.391,0
9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_0_30,first you know i'm just,0,686.271,689.153,1
9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_1_30,social media for vacancy like there is vacancy in the school,1,691.96,695.287,1

9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_1_32,date and they can just give their interviews but the thing that i'd like to ask them is not just some questions related to that anyone who are good at studies cannot be a teacher this is a thing i have learned like you can be brilliant in studies but teaching is just another creativity so that happens a lot there are lots of teachers those are like they are very good they are very good at studies they are very good at what they are teaching us but just the teaching capacity is not so good like we just get bored while listening to their lectures this is what i'd like to ensure how much nice they can teach they can entertain the students or not so this is one thing i'd like to ensure and so yes of course the knowledge is important of course the subject that they are supposed to teach i would take an interview or a test probably and then when i select some of the teachers for the school after that comes the main part that is to keep a check on them to keep an eye on them that they're performing their duties or not so i think sometimes it is good to tell the students sometimes ask the students how much how much good the teachers are teaching because it is important like the students are the best that who will know how much good the teachers are teaching and sometimes you know you can keep a check on those teachers with some other teachers that you want so these are the steps that i'd like to follow,1,711.273,800.924,1
9LLO6D3tIpc,9LLO6D3tIpc_0_32,a teacher this is a thing i have learned like you can be brilliant in studies but teaching is just another creativity so that happens a lot there are lots of teachers those are like they are very good they are very good at studies they are very good at what they are teaching,0,722.355,738.752,1

Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_0_4,app will be football but nowadays the methodology is totally changed we need to go with the sounds like uh a sound is a b b c so this uh initially we start with this then it helps the children i mean it helps child to it helps child for reading for developing reading,0,115.898,137.304,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_1_4,developing reading and other things right basically it's for reading right they become reading perfect with the help of phonics so reading is the major issues these days for mothers reading calligraphy so with the help of phonics it is easier for them to read out,1,136.242,154.846,0

Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_0_7,to go with single single letters right first of all i have to make them clear the concept of alphabets after that we need to actually work on the vowel sounds basically we need to tell them what are vowels and what are consonants with the help of vowels you can say vowels and somewhere it is pronounced as vowels i don't know which one is correct but i,0,183.734,208.249,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_1_7,alphabets after that we need to actually work on the vowel sounds basically we need to tell them what are vowels and what are consonants with the help of vowels you can say vowels and somewhere it is pronounced as vowels i don't know which one is correct but i pronounce both the ways right,1,189.951,212.037,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_0_8,the pronunciation i feel varies from,0,212.338,215.445,1
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_1_8,varies from region to region because british english is different american english is different,1,214.964,219.755,1
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_0_9,got the answer like that only like both are correct and something like that so basically we need to work on their long sounds and short sounds when we say cat it,0,233.224,245.344,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_1_9,e sound at the end that time we pronounce long vowel like mop right rope so this is the difference so vowels are basically matras in hindi right definitely,1,253.99,268.408,0

Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_0_17,and writing cool so we will not give you any reading intensive task but we will give you a very minor writing task from now on so for example you already know,0,422.963,432.344,1
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_1_17,already know that the topic of the day is travel right so you must have seen some questions also like which place do you like to travel to what kind of itineraries do you make when you travel so i would like to ask that right now that do you like to travel and if yes how do you plan a travel vacation,1,431.663,451.537,1

Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_1_19,once you get to the destination how do you decide which place to go and which place not to go,1,475.37,479.297,1
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_1_20,need to cover all right uh like this i go and also i talk to rickshaw and reset the uh like you can say,1,490.844,500.902,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_0_20,to rickshaw and reset the uh like you,0,495.634,499.781,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_0_21,to know more about that,0,516.966,517.989,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_1_21,which location is so accordingly i plan all the things right,1,521.178,529.92,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_2_2,that's nice so that's a very well thought plan and it really shows that you are somebody who has experience in this field as well so i'll also be using this technique usually whenever i go somewhere i just google but asking locals also is a very nice trick i can see so now i have a technique for you which is going to enable you to use the words that you already know in a more efficient way because many a times what happens is that we will know one hundred words but we will constantly keep using those twenty five words that are easy for us so now what we do this is that each time when we have to answer somebody and we have to answer in english what we do is we take a second pause,2,530.757,573.69,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_1_22,have a technique for you which is going to enable you to use the words that you already know in a more efficient way because many a times what happens is that we will know one hundred words but we will constantly keep using those twenty five words that are easy for us so now what we do this is that each time when we have to answer somebody and we have to answer in english what we do is we take a second pause this is called the golden rule of spoken english but i'll be tailoring it a bit so that your vocabulary needs are completely matched so what do you do is once you take a you take a pause and while you are thinking about what you are willing to speak make sure that before you start speaking you go through all the mental points that you have in your brain so that you are able to switch the words that are in your arsenal now for example if you knew that i will plan my day out and i will write it on a paper what is that that is an itinerary so if you are thinking about what you are going to speak before you actually speak you can replace that long line with one single word which is itinerary and all it will take you'll have to practice this but soon you'll be able to master this technique and this will happen within split seconds between conversations all you need to do is talk to yourself more often so for example you're combing your hair your hair are soft say that my hair are so soft you are thirsty where's your water bottle say where is my water bottle i need to drink some water you can do all exactly what we need to do here is train our brain to make reflexes in the english language only and soon all these issues will get resolved so for example if you ask me that kanishk how was your day today it's almost uh nine pm what did you do today so i'll say that since this is a wednesday wednesdays are very hectic for me my team had a meet we all submitted our projects and they have gone to the company for approvals and then i went for a small workout had some meals and now i am sitting at clappingo so i was able to structure it all properly only because i thought about it before i actually spoke it and all these things that i said just now i gave them a proper mental thought and that is what you need to do as well so now with this i want you to try out the same example that this is uh the wednesday is almost going to end so how was your day and what did you do today,1,548.862,701.19,1
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_2_3,okay this is called the golden rule of spoken english but i'll be tailoring it a bit so that your vocabulary needs are completely matched so what do you do is once you take a you take a pause and while you are thinking about what you are willing to speak make sure that before you start speaking you go through all the mental points that you have in your brain so that you are able to switch the words that are in your arsenal now for example if you knew that i will plan my day out and i will write it on a paper what is that that is an itinerary so if you are thinking about what you are going to speak before you actually speak you can replace that long line with one single word which is itinerary and all it will take you'll have to practice this but soon you'll be able to master this technique and this will happen within split seconds between conversations all you need to do is talk to yourself more often so for example you're combing your hair your hair are soft say that,2,573.47,638.237,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_2_4,wow my hair are so soft you are thirsty where's your water bottle say where is my water bottle i need to drink some water you can do all exactly what we need to do here is train our brain to make reflexes in the english language only and soon all these issues will get resolved so for example if you ask me that kanishk how was your day today it's almost uh nine pm what did you do today so i'll say that since this is a wednesday wednesdays are very hectic for me my team had a meet we all submitted our projects and they have gone to the company for approvals and then i went for a small workout had some meals and now i am sitting at clappingo so i was able to structure it all properly only because i thought about it before i actually spoke it and all these things that i said just now i gave them a proper mental thought and that is what you need to do as well,2,638.036,692.462,0
Fj7vpgKryb8,Fj7vpgKryb8_0_22,exactly what we need to do here is train our brain to make reflexes in the english language only and soon all these issues will get resolved so for example if you ask me that kanishk how was your day today it's almost uh nine pm what did you do today so i'll say that since this is a wednesday,0,645.266,663.759,1

ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_4,yeah nice to meet you,0,14.764,17.07,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_4,nice to meet you again,1,16.328,17.35,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_5,i got your message that,0,18.765,19.848,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_5,today you want to practice present perfect continuous tense right,1,19.908,24.041,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_0,okay great great well then we can definitely practice this today i think that this tenses can sometimes be a little bit more confusing it's not it's just not used as often so it's,2,27.242,43.799,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_6,then we can definitely practice this today i think that this tenses can sometimes be a little bit more,0,28.246,36.83,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_6,used as often so it's it might take a little bit more explanation but if you have any questions please just let me know okay,1,39.994,48.95,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_7,progressive so if you ever hear present perfect progressive this means the same thing as present perfect continuous,1,58.108,67.228,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_7,so if you ever hear present perfect progressive this means the same thing,0,60.072,65.203,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_1,and they have the same meaning but it's just they have sometimes are referred to in these different ways but this tense is a verb tense which is used to show that an action started in the past and has continued up until the present moment,2,68.59,87.501,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_2,okay so a little bit different from the ones we talked about before the present perfect continuous usually emphasizes duration so how long or the amount of time that an action has been taking place this is the main focus of present perfect continuous i'll type this out so that you can remember just give me one minute,2,87.28,114.761,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_8,just give me one minute so it emphasizes the duration,0,110.137,115.302,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_3,yeah so it emphasizes the duration of something how long that it takes that amount of time is what is most important and we can talk a little bit about some different uses or the form as well when we are writing sentences or speaking sentences using this tense so we'll start off with our form,2,114.781,138.551,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_8,well when we are writing sentences or speaking sentences using this tense so we'll start off with our form the form the form starts with um has or have then we add the word being and we finish with our present participle,1,129.529,154.079,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_4,okay the form the form starts with um has or have,2,138.23,145.552,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_5,okay then we add the word being,2,145.231,149.655,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_9,so this is basically the format that we use when we are creating sentences with,0,155.16,160.008,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_9,creating sentences with our present perfect tense,1,158.586,163.113,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_6,okay has or have been and then our present participle so basically we can make a statement like you have been waiting here for two hours,2,163.694,180.321,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_10,have been and then our present participle so basically we can make a statement like you have been waiting here for two hours something like that uses,0,165.016,180.961,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_7,okay something like that uses this format and is written in the present perfect progressive tense if we want to ask a question we just have to change the order of the sentence a little bit i could say the same topic but just changed to a question i could say sorry let me type this out one minute have you been waiting here for two hours,2,180.0,207.352,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_8,okay this is also using the same tense it's just changed into a question,2,207.091,213.965,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_9,okay have you been instead of you have been and then also if i want to change this to a negative,2,213.645,222.045,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_10,okay i could say something like you have not been waiting here for two hours and this is a negative so we just have to add not into our sentence or if you want you could use the contraction haven't,2,221.724,238.538,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_10,add not into our sentence or if you want you could use the contraction haven't you haven't been waiting here for two hours does that all make sense so far,1,232.544,243.027,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_11,up with some examples of this first then we'll move on a little bit talk more about the,0,246.666,251.197,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_11,we can form into a positive a negative and a question just like this example here can you think of one,1,260.381,267.315,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_12,and i get to i have i have not been using cambly,1,269.633,279.728,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_12,have i have not been using cambly,0,270.754,279.728,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_13,cambly for one week the amount of,0,292.901,298.51,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_13,been using cambly for one week then if you want to change this into a positive what could you say,1,304.18,309.97,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_14,i have been using cambly,0,311.582,313.464,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_14,i have been using cambly for one week,1,311.582,314.505,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_15,perfect perfect and then a,0,314.805,316.406,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_15,perfect perfect and then a question,1,314.805,316.926,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_16,how long have you been,0,320.444,321.867,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_16,long have you been working in cambly,1,320.665,323.631,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_11,very good very good or if you wanna use the same example you can say have you been using cambly for one week but yes that was great that was great let's continue now to the specific uses that we can have for the present perfect continuous,2,324.215,342.337,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_17,very good very good or if you wanna use the same example you can say have you been using cambly for one week but yes that was great that was great let's continue now to the specific uses that we can have for the present perfect continuous so the first use is similar to what i've already mentioned it's for a duration of something from the past until now we can use this to talk about something that started in the past and has continued up until the present moment that we are saying this sentence or that we are using this sentence so i can type out a few examples here let's see our first example might be something like four five minutes like for example i have been waiting for you four or five minutes or for two weeks i have been excited about this for two weeks,1,326.277,393.938,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_12,okay so the first use is similar to what i've already mentioned it's for a duration of something from the past until now we can use this to talk about something that started in the past and has continued up until the present moment that we are saying this sentence or that we are using this sentence,2,341.917,369.742,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_13,ok so i can type out a few examples here let's see our first example might be something like four five minutes,2,369.401,383.566,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_17,be something like four five minutes like for example,0,378.198,383.566,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_14,okay like for example i have been waiting for you four or five minutes,2,383.266,388.752,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_18,or something like if you're referring to a specific day you could say since tuesday i have been planning this,0,394.679,405.947,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_15,okay or something like if you're referring to a specific day you could say since tuesday,2,394.679,404.441,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_18,continued up until this point right now when i'm saying this all of these are durations which can be used with the present perfect continuous,1,410.621,419.25,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_19,daughter has been writing homework,0,427.164,430.276,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_19,has been writing homework for one hour,1,427.907,431.48,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_20,her homework for one hour perfect perfect let's try using a different measurement of time what about months can you come up with a sentence using this tense that uses months as a unit of time for example i can say i have been studying for five months this uses months as a way to measure time can you come up with a sentence that uses present perfect continuous and uses months as a measurement of time,1,436.521,472.636,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_20,months as a way to measure time,0,463.023,464.905,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_21,a half months perfect very good,0,488.349,490.983,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_21,half months perfect very good,1,488.389,490.983,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_16,awesome so these are basically the or this is basically the first kind of use i could give you a few more examples if you'd like using some different pronouns and that kind of thing different situations one might be they have been talking for the last hour,2,493.245,510.36,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_17,okay they have been talking for the last hour or i could say she has been working at that company for three years,2,510.099,521.087,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_18,okay our next one maybe what have you been doing for the last thirty minutes,2,520.726,527.294,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_19,okay this is a question that uses this tense or one more i could say why has nancy not been taking her medicine for the last three days,2,527.054,538.61,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_22,the last three days something like this all of these use present perfect continuous tense and for this purpose to talk about something that started in the past and has continued up to the present moment now our we have a second use for this tense as well the second use is to talk about something that using the words like recently or lately so we can also use present perfect continuous without duration without describing a specific amount of time so like for two weeks or anything like that we don't have to say without the duration the tense has a,0,535.145,579.129,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_20,okay something like this all of these use present perfect continuous tense and for this purpose to talk about something that started in the past and has continued up to the present moment,2,538.269,551.715,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_21,okay now our we have a second use for this tense as well,2,551.454,555.684,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_22,okay the second use is to talk about something that using the words like recently or lately,2,555.383,563.942,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_23,okay so we can also use present perfect continuous without duration,2,563.581,571.297,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_24,okay without describing a specific amount of time so like for two weeks or anything like that we don't have to say without the duration the tense has a more general meaning of like lately or recently,2,570.996,587.078,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_25,okay we often use the words lately or recently to emphasize this meaning,2,586.718,594.064,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_26,okay so this is kind of the second way that we can form a sentence in this present perfect continuous tense with just a slightly different kind of format,2,593.763,607.39,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_27,okay so i could say something like recently i have been feeling very tired or i've been feeling really tired,2,607.109,617.441,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_28,okay or um she has been watching too much television lately,2,617.12,626.051,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_29,okay um or something else might be have you been exercising lately,2,624.168,630.738,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_22,lately this might be a question uh that you could ask using this tense but in each of these sentences you'll notice that we don't use a specific period of time minutes weeks days months we just use the words recently or lately to describe the kind of time frame that we are talking about are you familiar with these terms recently and lately you know what they mean,1,630.498,656.018,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_30,yeah yeah i can understand uh and um,2,658.072,663.281,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_23,can understand uh and um uh the they have been,0,659.675,666.527,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_23,um uh the they have been playing cricket for the last two weeks,1,662.821,669.613,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_24,to this sentence or did you have it at the beginning i,0,680.398,686.214,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_24,beginning i didn't quite hear,1,685.011,686.795,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_31,yeah oh you said recently,2,689.89,691.758,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_32,yeah usually when we use recently or lately to kind of form our sentence in this way we either start with this word or we finish with this word you'll notice in my examples recently i have been feeling really tired so recently starts at the beginning it's the beginning of our sentence um or our second one she has been watching too much television lately lately's the last word in our sentence it finishes it or have you been exercising lately that one too finishes the sentence now you can choose which one you would like to say or which position you want to put it in both are correct so for example if i want to keep the sentence the same without changing the meaning i could change the order of this sentence for my first example i could say the way that i've already written it recently i have been feeling really tired,2,693.123,750.042,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_25,too much television lately lately's the last word in our sentence it finishes it or have you been exercising lately that one too finishes the sentence now you can choose which one you would like to say or which position you want to put it in both are,0,716.09,731.504,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_25,already written it recently i have been feeling really tired i'll write this one more time or i could say i have been feeling really tired recently,1,745.171,758.752,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_26,and this is the exact same,0,760.262,762.223,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_26,order of where i put that word recently gets switched,1,763.624,767.026,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_33,okay now if you decide to start with recently and you are writing this you need to put a comma after it,2,767.646,777.577,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_27,this you need to put a comma after it because it's like recently i have been really tired so there's a bit of a pause and so because of this you need to put a comma if it goes at the end you don't need to put a comma just the period after it does this make sense as well,1,774.878,792.965,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_27,put a comma after it because it's like recently i have,0,775.079,779.04,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_34,okay because it's like recently i have been really tired so there's a bit of a pause and so because of this you need to put a comma if it goes at the end you don't need to put a comma,2,777.256,789.644,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_28,a few more examples using these,0,797.133,798.754,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_28,more examples using these words recently or lately can you think of another example,1,797.973,803.139,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_29,i have been back up back up for last one hour,1,807.461,817.836,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_29,have been back up back up for last one,0,808.001,817.052,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_30,use the word recently or lately where could you add to that sentence to make it this format,1,820.78,826.332,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_30,recently or lately where could you add to that sentence to make,0,821.361,825.571,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_31,okay okay recently recently recently i have been waking up,0,827.471,833.228,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_31,okay okay recently recently recently i have been waking up,1,827.852,833.308,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_32,waking up early or i have been waking up early recently both are correct do you want to try one with lately,0,839.418,846.27,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_32,up early or i have been waking up early recently both are correct do you want to try one with lately,1,839.819,846.27,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_33,yeah i have been sleeping,0,846.29,857.081,1

ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_34,i've been sleeping a lot lately,1,858.365,859.669,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_35,that was great that was great,2,862.537,864.462,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_36,okay so basically these are the two kinds of main uses for this tense now one thing to remember is that the present perfect continuous kind of has this meaning already of lately or recently so if you use the present perfect continuous in a question such as have you been feeling all right it can already suggest to someone that the person might look sick or unhealthy because you're talking about what's happening right now or in the very very near kind of past so a question such as have you been smoking can suggest that you smell the smoke on the person or have you been feeling all right can suggest the person looks unwell so using this tense in a question suggests that you can see smell hear or feel the results of the action,2,864.141,919.827,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_0_35,perfect continuous in a question such as have you been feeling all right it can already suggest to someone that the person might look sick or unhealthy because you're talking about what's happening right now or in the very very near kind of past so a question such as have you been smoking can suggest that you smell the smoke on the person or have you been feeling all right can suggest the person looks unwell so using this tense in a question suggests that you can see smell hear or feel the results of the action so it's impossible,0,879.594,919.947,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_37,okay so it's impossible to insult someone too if you don't use this tense uh correctly um because of this because of how immediate the kind of sense that is given once you use this tense does that make sense as well,2,919.486,937.174,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_38,okay awesome awesome so that's just something to kind of keep in mind and it's also important to remember that non-continuous verbs cannot be used in any continuous tenses certain non-continuous meanings for mixed verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses either so instead of using present perfect continuous with these verbs you must use present perfect for example instead of saying sam has been having his car for two years this is not correct instead you would say sam has had his car for two years,2,936.693,979.654,1
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_1_35,any continuous tenses certain non-continuous meanings for mixed verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses either so instead of using present perfect continuous with these verbs you must use present perfect for example instead of saying sam has been having his car for two years this is not correct instead you would say sam has had his car for two years present perfect would be the correct way to say this sentence instead of present perfect continuous great do you have any more questions for me about this tense or was there anything you'd like me to explain a little bit more indomati,1,951.138,1000.076,0
ML_jNBcK6X4,ML_jNBcK6X4_2_39,okay present perfect would be the correct way to say this sentence instead of present perfect continuous,2,979.334,988.413,1

PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_43,no no i think only twice we have visited to doctor and we have just followed his instructions because that time everything was just um you know uh there was a lot of people in the hospital or there was a queue so it's quite risky to stand in the queue for one and two hour and wait for doctor apart from covid but um do you normally,2,948.045,979.753,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_0_37,followed his instructions because that time everything was just um you know uh there was a lot of people,0,952.47,962.094,1

PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_0_51,when you don't believe in something or when you are like um confused or what can i say there's a word but i don't remember it sort of confused or you you don't believe and you don't think that you'll get a disease or maybe whatever the reason not just the disease,0,1292.247,1312.155,1

PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_62,yeah it's not one of my interests but,2,1363.709,1367.173,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_1_53,exercise i think that if you keep doing exercise and yoga you don't need to,1,1396.667,1402.238,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_0_54,go to visit doctor you can a better way would be of saying that if,0,1403.802,1409.777,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_63,yeah you can a better way would be of saying that if you practice if you constantly consistently practice yoga meditation good healthy practices you would not have to visit the doctor,2,1407.21,1420.645,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_64,ok what you said is correct alternate ways,2,1420.445,1423.289,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_65,ok so just before i proceed i'll just give you a feedback so we don't run out of time,2,1422.648,1428.958,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_1_54,yes instead of parent becomes parent,1,1440.915,1443.764,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_0_55,parent yeah did i what did i,0,1444.841,1447.365,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_66,parent yeah did i what did i say parent,2,1444.841,1448.768,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_1_55,yeah did i what did i say parent a bit yeah parent,1,1445.883,1450.11,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_67,okay parents okay and disease disease,2,1452.495,1457.658,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_1_56,many words like in hindi we stress on a lot of sometimes you know if the e is small and big sometimes we stress according to the word right,1,1462.189,1472.288,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_0_56,small and big sometimes we,0,1468.861,1470.224,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_68,but in english we go a little more easy when we pronounce words,2,1473.089,1479.806,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_69,okay so just go a little more easy disease disease so disease is actually a combination of this and ease ease this means feeling good this is means not feeling good,2,1479.505,1497.247,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_1_57,easy when we pronounce words so just go a little more easy disease disease so disease is actually a combination of this and ease ease this means feeling good this is means not feeling good that means not at ease this is very well so just this pronunciation of few things sometimes what you do like because you speak well there are just these few things here and there for example i think today i would like you to to concentrate a bit on your pronunciation open the dictionary randomly just pronounce random words you don't have to know the meaning you don't have to know anything try and familiarize yourself can you read a difficult word because in dictionary there are a lot of difficult words how are you reading it what are the sounds just so you pick up on the uh sounds of the language each language has different sounds the sounds in hindi are different the sounds in english are different like i cannot produce some sounds in hindi simply because i'm not very familiar with few of it just like that you have to be familiar with producing the sounds in english so you open a dictionary randomly just aloud in the middle pronounce few words with regard to your sentence formation i corrected a few of them on spot and some you do correct yourself so i know that you do know but because of the speed maybe sometimes uh you tend to miss out or eat up one or two words so it's just those tiny things that you have to take care of any doubts that you have for me any area that you're facing a problem with you need suggestions,1,1480.807,1597.497,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_70,okay that means not at ease this is,2,1496.687,1501.922,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_71,okay very well so just this pronunciation of few things sometimes what you do like because you speak well,2,1502.765,1510.283,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_72,okay there are just these few things here and there for example i think today i would like you to to concentrate a bit on your pronunciation open the dictionary randomly,2,1510.063,1521.716,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_73,okay just pronounce random words you don't have to know the meaning you don't have to know anything try and familiarize yourself,2,1521.434,1530.001,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_0_57,try and familiarize yourself can you read a difficult word because in dictionary there are a lot of difficult words how are you reading it what are the sounds just so you pick up on the uh sounds of the language each language has different sounds the sounds in hindi are different the sounds in english are different like i cannot produce some sounds in hindi simply because i'm not very familiar with few of it just like that you have to be familiar with producing the sounds in english so you open a dictionary randomly just aloud in the middle pronounce few words with regard to your sentence formation i corrected a few of them on spot and some you do correct yourself so i know that you do know but because of the speed maybe sometimes uh you tend to miss out or eat up one or two words so it's just those tiny things that you have,0,1524.789,1585.695,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_74,oh can you read a difficult word because in dictionary there are a lot of difficult words how are you reading it what are the sounds just so you pick up on the uh sounds of the language each language has different sounds,2,1529.861,1544.391,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_75,okay the sounds in hindi are different the sounds in english are different like i cannot produce some sounds in hindi simply because i'm not very familiar with few of it just like that you have to be familiar with producing the sounds in english so you open a dictionary randomly just aloud in the middle pronounce few words,2,1544.17,1570.275,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_76,okay with regard to your sentence formation i corrected a few of them on spot and some you do correct yourself so i know that you do know but because of the speed maybe sometimes uh you tend to miss out or eat up one or two words,2,1569.233,1587.478,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_0_58,i use exactly and obviously a lot of time i observe this whenever i like watch my recordings i feel that i use these things a lot so can you like suggest me or help me out to remove so one,0,1604.115,1622.122,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_1_58,i use exactly and obviously a lot of time i observe this whenever i like watch my recordings i feel that i use these things a lot so can you like suggest me or help me out to remove so one thing is,1,1604.115,1622.544,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_0_59,we all have a tendency of,0,1623.266,1624.788,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_77,we all have a tendency of using certain words repeatedly like i'll be like,2,1623.266,1627.772,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_78,oh you know you know i see so we have that,2,1627.692,1632.561,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_1_59,you know you know i see so we have that because those words help us to speak somehow it's natural to if you do want to omit the usage try coming up with synonyms of alternative words alternative words and try using them so you won't be repeating it but it's not bad to use no it's not because i myself use a lot of things i'm like look here listen like exactly and i'm like perfect like i use perfect a lot so it's just something we are familiar with and it gives us an ease of conversation but if you want to omit it yes you can definitely try using synonyms so it'll reduce your usage or dependency to fill your sentences with that word okay,1,1629.875,1683.12,0
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_79,okay because those words help us to speak somehow it's natural to if you do want to omit the usage try coming up with synonyms of alternative words alternative words and try using them so you won't be repeating it but it's not bad to use no it's not because i myself use a lot of things i'm like,2,1632.32,1658.702,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_80,oh exactly and i'm like,2,1661.089,1662.472,1
PkMwJZo-5go,PkMwJZo-5go_2_81,yeah or maybe try not to begin by saying these things like if i ask you something hey do you like chocolate obviously i like it no no try saying uh yes i do love chocolate a lot that's wonderful or try using something like wonderful that's amazing try using those exclamations,2,1684.467,1706.429,1

Q9JBo4h77uk,Q9JBo4h77uk_2_8,basically in my opinion there should be three languages a person or children should learn because first thing should be like a national language which they are allowed to speak international language that is english language and the third one any specific language there should be you know learned like chinese and japanese which is which are the developed countries' language yes very good you know if you have to learn the european languages like german or spanish or so these are the languages should be taught in the you know in schools and for children so they can also hone their skills and when they grow up and when they feel interest to go abroad so there was no lag behind in speaking languages so the three languages should be provided to them and since childhood since they are in the schools so that they will build up their personalities to explore new things new ideas because when your brain learns new things or new languages a new culture new traditions you know comes into the brain like,2,548.908,618.963,0
Q9JBo4h77uk,Q9JBo4h77uk_1_26,schools and for children so they can also hone their skills and when they grow up and when they feel interest to go abroad so there was no lag behind in speaking languages so the three languages should be provided to them and since childhood since they are in the schools so that they will build up their personalities to explore new things new ideas because when your brain learns new things or new languages a new culture new traditions you know comes into the brain like then you know starts thinking in those languages yeah,1,586.683,622.306,1

QEs3dAj23R4,QEs3dAj23R4_2_13,yeah that's how we do it right so now that you're a fluent speaker i think maybe you can take you can move on to the next stage the next stage is how to start conversing to a stranger so here i was asking you a lot of questions you never asked anything about me but i did volunteer isn't it so that's the art of trying to make a conversation now all conversations are not really insightful and meaningful but however in today's world that really makes a lot of difference so let's try that why don't you try initiating a conversation with me,2,769.464,808.361,0

_cPdJMttGj0,_cPdJMttGj0_2_25,okay so that let's not have that in the market list so going to enjoy with your friends switching off the mobile phone and um after that what else what was the other thing i like the word that he used explore instead of telling i would like to go and visit and see uttarakhand it's more of exploring exploring is a deeper word we have a lot of places in india we don't have to actually go to other parts of the world that's what i feel we have a lot to explore in our country it's like one world right right is uh understanding the nature the culture the tradition trying to relate with them with the people with the environment all that is there in exploring,2,760.051,806.124,0
_cPdJMttGj0,_cPdJMttGj0_2_26,okay and trying to understand yourself better when you go to another place you understand yourself also it's a discovery of the self right that's wonderful right i'll just correct you in some places sentence formation so you said one of the things instead of telling one of the things from my bucket list or in my bucket list you forgot the prepositions again so it was prepositions this time you forgot in you forgot from but words were there and you were able to manage with the sentences so that's fine you were able to express and tell me this is what i wanted this is what i will do in the future right so just take a note of the prepositions try to insert it at the right places like small small prepositions in at over behind something that you can also for example you said that i don't want to put this in my bucket list which is a desire it's something over my head that is to own to possess an expensive car,2,805.883,870.799,0
_cPdJMttGj0,_cPdJMttGj0_1_17,the sentences so that's fine you were able to express and tell me this is what i wanted this is what i will do in the future right so just take a note of the prepositions try to insert it at the right places like small small prepositions in at over behind something that you can also for example you said that i don't want to put this in my bucket list which is a desire it's something over my head that is to own to possess an expensive car right so like that it is over my head it's over my thought also but still i get the thought again to possess a car which i really don't need that's my want so that is why i ask you like after the sessions each time after the session you try to write it down you'll get better thoughts and when you write it down the next time you tell the same experience to someone else in another context also you will get reminded of these words it happens automatically this is the power of our human brain,1,836.45,900.257,1
_cPdJMttGj0,_cPdJMttGj0_2_27,that's why uh from a very early age teachers ask us to write and study write and learn,2,901.986,908.424,0
_cPdJMttGj0,_cPdJMttGj0_2_28,okay but maybe some of them were not able to give the technical part and the psychological part of it but this is what actually happens your brain will immediately visualize it will connect and next time when you try to reproduce it it will be like you know it happens automatically if you had your mind and presence of mind and everything when you were learning and studying and drawing pictures so that is one way of working on the words,2,908.183,935.071,0
_cPdJMttGj0,_cPdJMttGj0_1_18,maybe some of them were not able to give the technical part and the psychological part of it but this is what actually happens your brain will immediately visualize it will connect and next time when you try to reproduce it it will be like you know it happens automatically if you had your mind and presence of mind and everything when you were learning and studying and drawing pictures so that is one way of working on the words so one more tip is when you write down the words in your pocket diary try to associate an image if possible like some words they're observed observed they will not have you cannot connect it with an image if that is not possible you can connect it with a situation,1,910.181,952.246,1
_cPdJMttGj0,_cPdJMttGj0_0_18,mind and presence of mind and everything when you were learning and studying and drawing pictures so that is one way of working on the words so one more tip is when you,0,925.404,936.515,1
_cPdJMttGj0,_cPdJMttGj0_2_29,for example if you're coming across the word empower empower usually we talk about women empowerment you can think for yourself you can say men empowerment empowering the men,2,954.329,967.757,0

_cPdJMttGj0,_cPdJMttGj0_1_19,say men empowerment empowering the men that's also important so when you have a different thought you will get reminded of this in some other during some other situation also so empowering it's not that you're going to speak about men empowerment or empowering a man but you'll remember the meaning i thought about this because so that connection quickly,1,965.692,989.131,1
_cPdJMttGj0,_cPdJMttGj0_2_30,okay that's also important so when you have a different thought you will get reminded of this in some other during some other situation also so empowering it's not that you're going to speak about men empowerment or empowering a man but you'll remember the meaning,2,967.477,985.705,0

dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_2_12,okay and one negative i could make of that uh,2,555.504,559.306,0
dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_1_41,seeing the present situation in our country it has been come to notice that some judges are being biased,1,564.664,574.453,1
dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_2_13,which they should not be,2,575.45,577.274,1

dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_0_42,you're very confident when you speak see there's no problem your grammar is good your vocabulary is good you are quite fluent also but you don't have the flow the flow is not there and usually when it comes to players who are associated with sports you're confident by birth you're confident now coming to flow the flow is not there because i think you're not practicing,0,588.312,617.293,0
dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_2_16,okay you're very confident when you speak,2,590.935,595.355,1
dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_1_42,it comes to players who are associated with sports you're confident by birth you're confident now coming to flow the flow is not there because i think you're not practicing enough after the sessions,1,609.002,620.281,0
dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_1_43,have a surrounding any surrounding to people to talk to i don't have that environment the only thing that when i talk to people is over here on clapping,1,622.485,635.022,1

dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_2_17,the environment and surrounding is something that is paced by a lot of people even me but there are some activities that you can do by yourself to check your progress because we are living in a place in a country where the native spoken language is not english so we cannot help that you're helpless so try to do some activities as these to create communication with yourself i think that's a natural way of developing any language,2,637.789,667.402,1
dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_0_44,are living in a place in a country where the native spoken language is not english so we cannot help that you're helpless so try to do some activities as these to create communication with yourself i think that's a natural way of developing any language you can make use of some words as these ask yourself questions because when it comes to english or any language you will not be able to convey things that you're very familiar with will be able to give a lot of information on a topic you can read and find out and give but when it comes to familiar topics we will not,0,650.185,687.373,0
dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_2_18,okay you can make use of some words as these ask yourself questions because when it comes to english or any language you will not be able to convey things that you're very familiar with will be able to give a lot of information on a topic you can read and find out and give but when it comes to familiar topics we will not think about the expressions so try to practice more so that you develop a flow otherwise all the aspects are good and you have to work on reading aloud also because your pronunciation and articulation should become better,2,667.141,701.311,1
dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_1_44,area of interest is sports,1,722.495,723.816,0

dgL_eLK62o0,dgL_eLK62o0_2_19,yeah so here you you don't have any such problems but i think we should develop we should work on the flow and articulation so work at least for twenty minutes by reading aloud by working on words and also practicing with activities i think that will help you,2,788.405,805.987,1

j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_2_5,i was expecting that so it's my vacation going on that's why i'm here and so i am supposed to relax and chill so i wake up only after nine every day so,2,138.725,151.457,1
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_0_12,and chill so i wake up only after nine every day so not before nine,0,145.397,152.419,0
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_1_12,wake up only after nine every day so not before nine nine nine thirty or ten by ten i am up,1,147.149,155.284,0
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_1_13,so let me tell you one thing that why i don't know lots of people have idea in their mind that if they're waking up to well like after eight it means you know they are chilling but i don't think so,1,156.325,170.695,1
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_0_13,you one thing that why i don't know lots of people have idea in their mind that if,0,157.186,162.235,1
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_1_14,okay so why don't you think so,1,171.637,173.742,0

j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_0_15,because i can see one,0,174.619,176.122,1
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_1_15,are looking more beautiful than ever before even if i look at buildings they are looking beautiful in the morning they have a special beauty,1,190.736,200.401,1
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_2_6,yeah and the weather and everything see i agree and there was a time when i had to wake up between five to six when i was in delhi and everything so,2,200.641,211.17,1
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_0_16,to six when i was in delhi and everything so once i get into a habit,0,207.678,212.192,0
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_2_7,yeah once i get into a habit it's fine and everything but uh like i won't you know speak for others but in my case especially i am not a morning person,2,210.95,221.413,1
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_2_8,okay i'm strictly not a morning person in the sense that somewhere i would say my health doesn't support me like i start sneezing if i wake up too early so basically i sneeze if i wake up out of my will so that is one reason why my parents also never forced me to wake up early because then if i start sneezing they'll regret waking me up so that is how it has been since childhood and even when i had to study for extras or something i always sat up late at night i never woke up in the morning so that is one reason why but i definitely agree with your point that everything is more beautiful when it's in the morning so yes i will get back to that routine soon all right so um,2,221.132,275.789,1
j0SyaCJnnKY,j0SyaCJnnKY_1_16,all right so um have you gone through the session document,1,274.006,277.672,0

kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_13,a great question i think,1,283.307,284.248,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_2_3,how smart should one be,2,285.425,287.451,1

kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_14,one be generally when they get a smartphone in their hand,1,286.769,291.04,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_15,that as far as today's generation is concerned we all are having a smartphone so the attention span is very less like it reduced to thirty seconds like when somebody,0,294.235,308.336,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_15,span is very less like it reduced to thirty seconds like when somebody is in instagram so the reels is of ten fifteen seconds so the attention span of people becomes very less so they should take care in that aspect when they are using such social media platforms that they should think about the time they should balance their work and entertainment so that's my advice,1,302.237,332.618,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_2_4,yes that's true actually it's a very valid point reels are like they're designed in such a way that you get things in packets instant if there is a very big topic they will compress it and they will present it within thirty to sixty seconds uh that is a skill that is good but still sometimes as you rightly said the world is getting used to small small packets and instant energy it's like instant booster and things like that where you need to give a lot of focus like for example recently one learner asked me can i learn english in fifteen days thirty days i said it is possible but you need to be consistent it is possible but you can't have things in instant packets right we are used to such things yes that's a very valid point,2,333.291,379.302,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_16,energy it's like instant booster and things like that where you need to give a lot of focus like for example recently one learner asked me can,0,357.842,365.425,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_2_5,okay the next word is strong strong,2,379.081,385.193,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_2_6,okay strong now as you said uh we have got this problem with attention span things like that and we get connected with different people through social media channels we have lot of platforms what do you think sakshyam do you think the present generation is strong mentally see we have got access to a lot of things compared to fifteen years back we didn't have connectivity at all now we can connect with anyone,2,384.893,410.672,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_16,connectivity at all now we can connect with anyone anywhere in the world what do you think is the present generation not the generation alone take people from any age category are they mentally strong suppose if there's a problem like you use the social media there'll be a problem do you think people are mentally strong and how do they deal what are your observations,1,407.722,428.631,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_17,few people who are mentally strong but a majority of people,0,433.467,436.832,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_17,my suggestion i think that meditation is very important when we talk about social media and all if we want to get rid of the distraction of social media we should everybody should do meditation so that it gives a kind of clarity mind that whether we are doing the right thing or wrong thing,1,454.913,478.861,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_2_7,it's a kind of detoxification process when you meditate you have a lot of toxins inside your mind and body and it gets detoxified so it is great and people should find time for that and i feel people are losing out on values also generally it's not that people are bad but sometimes they don't think about the culture or the values that is also a very important point value is important we cannot behave like some other people from some other planet i feel animals have got values these days they can feel uh they they value life than us that is what i feel,2,479.001,515.309,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_18,have a lot of toxins inside your mind and body and it gets detoxified so it is great and people should find time for that and i feel people are losing out on values also generally it's not that people are bad but sometimes they don't think about the culture or the values that is also a very important point value is important we cannot behave like some other people from some other planet i feel animals have got values these days they can feel uh they they value life than us that is what i feel anyway um so the next task is this is the next word season season and social media can you use both the words in a sentence season social media,1,482.989,528.779,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_18,value is important we cannot behave like some other people from some other planet i feel animals have got values these days they can feel uh they they value life than us that is what i,0,501.432,514.788,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_19,in social media like for example there is a cricket world cup so the social media suppose there is a season of cricket world cup so the social media everybody are intrigued in that particular domain for example there is,0,538.226,555.275,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_19,so the social media everybody are intrigued in that particular domain for example there is elections and season of elections so everybody starts surfing on social media for the election,1,548.51,563.17,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_20,on it and they're intrigued by,0,565.362,566.965,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_20,by that domain they start involving themselves they get engaged with that domain yes correct last part,1,566.725,574.594,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_21,with with this social media how do you think english learning has become easy or difficult like the pros and cons,0,577.463,585.016,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_21,become easy or difficult like the pros and cons,1,580.769,585.016,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_22,so he can easily search its meaning on the google and find it within,0,594.755,599.083,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_22,social media because many students are watching videos and they are not practicing it but mathematics require a kind of we have to take copy pen and you know solve it the more we practice the better we become so mathematics become a little bit uncomfortable,1,614.371,632.595,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_23,okay okay yeah that's fine there should be this,0,633.53,636.356,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_23,platter yes since the pandemic so i'll just give you the feedback is that okay,1,647.94,653.814,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_2_8,okay so i corrected you with few words like algorithm get ethics all these words and i can see that you are improving a lot on the usage of words your vocabulary got enriched like overdue indulge intrigue side effect all these words you're using at the right time maybe you need to work on your prepositions that is what i feel at in the to in you know about it but either unnecessarily you're using it in some places or sometimes you're missing out on it so either it's not there or it's like you are not putting it in the right place you're not using it either way it happens,2,654.676,700.184,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_24,words and i can see that you are improving a lot on the usage of words your vocabulary got enriched like overdue indulge intrigue side effect all these words you're using at the right time maybe you,0,661.118,676.231,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_24,can ask me so that is what you have to work on prepositions in sentence,1,719.7,723.569,0
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_25,of this addiction of social media so how can he motivate his family members to help his family member to overcome the addiction,1,738.739,750.546,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_25,he motivate his family members to help his family,0,741.846,746.995,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_0_26,okay that is a very,0,751.567,753.008,0

kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_2_9,okay so if people are addicted to social media and one person is not addicted or wants to choose another path it's very difficult it's like what happens action is when you go and tell your family members or when you try to motivate through your simple action they say you are mad you are living in this digital world suppose i'll give you one example if you start reading books when all the others are engaged with their mobile phones or tabs or whatever it is first thing is you will face criticism because you are choosing a different path but what i feel is you know that something is addiction and that something is not good for your health you have to keep at it criticism may come but when you keep at it and when you prove that reading or engaging in some games or talking to people helps your mind helps your body when you prove it out and when an ambience is created people will start supporting you for example if everybody is sitting in front of the laptop and only you want to have a conversation sometimes what happens in most of the homes they will say please go don't disturb i'm doing my work we can't keep on asking them or we can't even try to motivate them but what could be done is you should take small small instances or some free time when people sit at least to look at each other they're instead of giving a big speech you can show them what could be done like bring a carom board hey come on just five minutes let's play let's rekindle our memories from the childhood days,2,756.49,856.84,1
kyijXlgvSW0,kyijXlgvSW0_1_27,one person is not addicted or wants to choose another path it's very difficult it's like what happens action is when you go and tell your family members or when you try to motivate through your simple action they say you are mad you are living in this digital world suppose i'll give you one example if you start reading books when all the others are engaged with their mobile phones or tabs or whatever it is first thing is you will face criticism because you are choosing a different path but what i feel is you know that something is addiction and that something is not good for your health you have to keep at it criticism may come but when you keep at it and when you prove that reading or engaging in some games or talking to people helps your mind helps your body when you prove it out and when an ambience is created people will start supporting you for example if everybody is sitting in front of the laptop and only you want to have a conversation sometimes what happens in most of the homes they will say please go don't disturb i'm doing my work we can't keep on asking them or we can't even try to motivate them but what could be done is you should take small small instances or some free time when people sit at least to look at each other they're instead of giving a big speech you can show them what could be done like bring a carom board hey come on just five minutes let's play let's rekindle our memories from the childhood days so five minutes they sit and they play so you have one there or even if it's just three minutes you are the winner there where they understand playing carrom boat it's nice you laugh and you crack some jokes it will happen because we still have that base of humanity in each of us so one thing is criticism will be there or maybe just a comment will be there some discouragement will be there but you are choosing a different path for the goods keep at it after that prove that there are better things that you can do in this world and enjoy the little moments that's really nice yes because when when i smile at you you smile back and that is contagious the same thing should happen within the family early in the morning we go for work we don't meet our family members at least have dinner together smile at each other how was your day everything will be all right you don't need to really understand the problem of another person but these words this smile all these things can change a lot of things so it was a nice session with you as usual and i hope you get all the points we are coming to the end of the session anything else that you would like to know quickly just one more minute is there,1,764.275,931.203,0

lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_8,and you would like to provide,0,172.194,173.498,1

lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_10,took a lot of sessions from the clappingo so how you came up with the thought of clappingo and how do you came to know about clappingo,1,300.872,308.181,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_2_2,actually when i started doing a lot of mistakes in my videos and i've seen that my videos are not getting the good views because of doing a lot of mistakes i'm not really good with my with my grammar part so i thought i think it's time to improve myself i need to work upon myself because now my baby started going to school so i'm getting enough time so i joined,2,309.534,330.401,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_11,videos and i've seen that my videos are not getting the good views because of doing a lot of mistakes i'm not really good with my with my grammar part so i thought i think it's time to improve myself i need to work upon myself because now my baby started going to school so i'm getting enough time so i joined and luckily clapping also work well for me because because after,0,312.24,334.63,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_11,the good views because of doing a lot of mistakes i'm not really good with my with my grammar part so i thought i think it's time to improve myself i need to work upon myself because now my baby started going to school so i'm getting enough time so i joined and luckily clapping also work well for me because because after joining clapping i have seen a visible changes in my grammar my grammar is little better than earlier if you will watch my videos from like six months ago you will find so many grammatical mistakes i did not even use know how to use did where to use does where to use do but now at least i knew some of them it's a very good platform for me,1,314.785,354.73,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_12,course the covid-nineteen period was there so you're just,0,358.367,361.072,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_12,you to just think about it but now he goes to school so now you can attend sessions and you can do some classes and it is very helpful for you i think so right yes,1,365.141,374.817,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_13,from this i would like,0,377.436,378.336,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_13,do what is the one of the most important things to do if anybody would like to start just you know his journey,1,383.962,390.133,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_14,first thing which you should have is dedication you know what i know the importance of learning english when i was in like my teenage but i did not do anything because i was not really dedicated to learn that when mitansh came into my life there is some goal in my mind that i have to teach this i have to teach this that's why i dedicated to make him learn secondly i started watching youtube videos listening,0,391.556,417.624,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_14,anything like or similarly i did it i used to listen i used to watch a lot of videos on youtube i spent my most of the times like watching youtube videos this was the first step i think and this should be yeah,1,433.425,446.116,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_15,lot of people like covid time,0,449.515,451.338,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_15,mean to say that they got a lot of laser time to explore their skills what i feel even though same for me when i started working it was like really fantastic to watch a lot of videos and you said it right like it is very important to listen and observe then after because this is a natural birth method how a baby like learns like that right so the next thing i would like to know that a lot of people they are just confused that what they should go for like first they should work on their vocabulary a lot of people you will hear saying that that sir i am able to i'm not able to speak good english because i don't know a lot of words so what do you specifically do for the vocabulary part,1,452.48,493.478,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_16,many channels on youtube they provide daily use sentences short video that's only for one minute and they give like fourteen to fifteen sentences in that one minute and every sentence has one vocabulary so when i watch those videos i've learned vocabulary automatically and this is truly i'm telling you it's not like you're saying this is the method only i've learned the vocabulary vocabulary is already around us it's just need to use that properly we don't know how to use them in your communication so just need to focus conscious while,0,498.942,527.314,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_16,need to use that properly we don't know how to use them in your communication so just need to focus conscious while speaking you will able to remember all those vocabularies around you,1,520.78,530.36,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_2_3,simple yeah that's great so the another point i'm just coming to that is the fluency what do you think about fluency a lot of people they are just really worried about fluency,2,531.274,541.825,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_17,that's great so the another point i'm just coming to that is the fluency what do you think about fluency a lot of people they are just really worried about fluency sir i'm not fluent ma'am i'm not fluent at all and they would like to speak like a super fast train i don't really think so fluency means to speaking like a private jet you can if you're speaking,0,532.015,553.269,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_17,just really worried about fluency sir i'm not fluent ma'am i'm not fluent at all and they would like to speak like a super fast train i don't really think so fluency means to speaking like a private jet you can if you're speaking without getting any pause without getting stuck then of course you are ready to go that is fluency right so what do you think about it what is your opinion on that,1,540.103,563.537,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_2_4,oh sir i'm not fluent,2,541.705,543.546,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_2_5,i don't know when you were saying this like people speak like fast like train i remember myself because many of the clap lingua tutors commented me on that that you speak very fast you should you should work on your pace actually if you will start working on your pace you can reduce your grammatical errors as well as sometimes i used to articles conjunctions here and there so i can reduce them but trust me i'm not doing it knowingly it is in my nature fluency is actually always there i don't have to struggle for fluency actually even in hindi i'm this much fluent in hindi as well similarly when i speak in english i am same fluency in english the reason is only one because i don't think much about grammar while speaking this is the only reason that i have become fluent if i'll keep thinking about grammar like what i should say then a hundred percent it will impact my fluency so what was my thinking i just want to be fluent i did not focus more on grammar generally people are like learners they started focusing more on grammar at their initial stage they want to be perfect they want to speak correct sentences which is not possible at the beginning you cannot be perfect at your beginning you have to spend some time you have to do mistakes at the beginning then only you will be perfect so i did not focus more on grammar and that is why my fluency is there once i've become fluid i started focusing on grammar actually so now i'm quite,2,564.691,651.954,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_18,this like people speak like fast like train i remember myself because many of the,0,565.752,569.874,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_18,they started focusing more on grammar at their initial stage they want to be perfect they want to speak correct sentences which is not possible at the beginning you cannot be perfect at your beginning you have to spend some time you have to do mistakes at the beginning then only you will be perfect so i did not focus more on grammar and that is why my fluency is there once i've become fluid i started focusing on grammar actually so now i'm quite eighty percent of grammar i say is correct i think,1,629.052,656.953,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_19,and the people they are not getting you then what is the meaning of your speaking because we are video content creators right and most of the time we are trying to reach to the people who are strangers to us but if you will speak fast your parents they are going to understand because they are habitual to listen to you if any new person is watching you he will not be able to understand you right so it is very important for us to focus on the pace of speaking it must be moderate not fast not really low it should be understandable that is a very just you know genuine point what i got in my journey also i'll tell you one example like when i also started speaking and i used to speak very fast and i give an example for that whenever you are learning how to ride a motorbike or a scooter that you will not be able to control your accelerator it happens right in the beginning of the journey when you are learning how to ride that scooter so same it happens with english speaking as well when you will start learning you will not be able to control your accelerator and it will go very fast even though you want to control yourself speaking in the front of camera sometimes what happens you want to speak in a way that people they can understand you but you will like you know due to a nervousness and a lot of things going on in your mind so you will speak too much fast you would like to complete as early as possible this is very important to speak in a way that people can understand you so now i'm just you know coming to like some other points like there are a few more things in english people are always having the questions about that like how to just you know work on their accent phrases idioms what do you think do you give any kind of importance to such kind of things,1,688.728,799.087,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_19,really low it should be understandable that is a very just you know genuine point what i got in my journey also i'll tell you one example like when i also started speaking and i used to speak very fast and i give an example for that whenever you are learning how to ride,0,719.097,735.001,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_2_6,to be frank i am not that kind of person who feel like i need to learn advanced english idioms phrases and all but it's my subscriber sometimes they comment me that man now you should you know raise the standard of your learning english and you are good at your basic english now you you should go to the advanced level so you should learn idioms and phrases but personally people who are beginners uh i'm telling for them especially that learning fancy words idioms phases is not really important important thing is that having a communication which understood by the other person like you must be able to convey your idea to somebody else that whatever you want to say he understand in the same manner that is,2,800.309,844.075,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_20,advanced level so you should learn idioms and phrases but personally people who are beginners uh i'm telling for them especially that learning,0,818.104,825.852,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_20,you know comment to me that i love your accent because i'm speaking naturally i'm not trying trying to imitate somebody else or trying to speak like foreigners or copy another accent so your natural accent is really good to go you don't need to work upon your accent at least at the beginning once you will be on advanced you are like a good speaker you want to master this language then you should work upon on your pronunciation i must say not the accent actually pronunciation is important if you're pronouncing something in a correct manner that will be understood by the other people also,1,862.653,894.302,0
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_21,course accent is the very last thing when,0,896.679,898.743,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_21,and you are able to present yourself in a wonderful way then you can go for it it depends on the person's choice right,1,899.665,905.557,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_0_22,can't force any opinion on someone right so that is very important and as you said it is very important to work on pronunciation you are absolutely right so like and what about like as you said that idioms and,0,906.67,921.685,1
lkRpPcY6hp4,lkRpPcY6hp4_1_22,phrases do you think now you should work on,1,921.745,924.593,1

mA8EoHtMiQc,mA8EoHtMiQc_1_53,speaker very much into the conversation and you also have a lot of gestures while talking right like you move your hand to that even i have this habit i constantly shake my hand and i'll shake my head so this is how i express you're very expressive and you're always smiling so that makes you very communicative communicative and interactive and the only thing you can improve is the you know few times you make a little bit grammatical error with tense maybe a little tense problem you have so you can further more you know for spoken english now we can't tell you to practice right like you know practice is something children will do like you know practice exercise and all that's for the children right so not everybody has the time to do it so what i can suggest is listen to english more keep your surrounding in england and that's how you're going to practice so the more you listen and you speak in that way speak in the same way you get the hang of it so listening is the big thing in spoken english listen and then speak in the similar way,1,917.089,984.704,1

mA8EoHtMiQc,mA8EoHtMiQc_2_19,okay and that's how you're going to practice so the more you listen and you speak in that way speak in the same way you get the hang of it so listening is the big thing in spoken english,2,969.657,982.836,0

nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_1_18,the fresher is you use your life experiences to tell them why,1,316.718,320.01,0
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_1_19,so again i don't know a lot about engineering,1,321.537,324.06,0
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_0_19,i don't know a lot,0,322.198,323.019,0
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_2_9,so i'm going to take my example why i think i'm a good fit at clapping go as a tutor,2,325.062,330.811,1
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_1_20,going to take my example why i think i'm a good fit at clapping go as a tutor let's say i'm taking i'm having a job interview right now,1,325.402,334.328,0
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_0_20,fit at clapping go as a tutor let's say i'm taking i'm having,0,328.126,333.082,0
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_2_10,okay and um obviously um they will ask me a certain question why do why do you think you're a good fit i'll tell them i think i'm a good fit at clapping go as a tutor because i focus more on making them understand the concept not just learn it if you remember a concept you may forget it and make a mistake but if you understand the concept then i don't think you can make many mistakes i am very good with examples i will make sure that when they don't understand i will put in how much ever time needed but help them understand the thing so that tomorrow when someone asks them a question they know the concept so i am telling the company why i am a good fit for this job not why i needed it or why they should hire me tell them things just think about it this way they are selfish they are not selfish i'm just generally giving you a hack think about it this way what can i give to the company that they would really like to hear and i'm not saying lie at all don't lie just let them know what your experiences are so now in engineering you can say ever since i was a kid i was interested in engineering and everyone around me noticed it and they said that you know indrajit you should really become an engineer you're always curious about how these electronics work or how you know cars work or toys work right so as a kid i would i would open up toys to try to figure out how it works so i was always curious and that's why i think i'm a perfect fit for this job is because of my curiosity i'm always curious to learn more i always make sure that when i start a project i finish it or i follow through with it these are things they don't hear so don't give them very common answers,2,334.963,449.746,1
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_1_21,them understand the thing so that tomorrow when someone asks them a question they know the concept so i am telling the company why i am a good fit for this job not why i needed it or why they should hire me tell them things just think about it this way they are selfish they are not selfish i'm just generally giving you a hack think about it this way what can i give to the company that they would really like to hear and i'm not saying lie at all don't lie just let them know what your experiences are so now in engineering you can say ever since i was a kid i was interested in engineering and everyone around me noticed it and they said that you know indrajit you should really become an engineer you're always curious about how these electronics work or how you know cars work or toys work right so as a kid i would i would open up toys to try to figure out how it works so i was always curious and that's why i think i'm a perfect fit for this job is because of my curiosity i'm always curious to learn more i always make sure that when i start a project i finish it or i follow through with it these are things they don't hear so don't give them very common answers yes does that make sense perfect all right what else what other questions will they ask you,1,371.073,458.792,0
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_0_21,i'm just generally giving you a hack think about it this way what can i give to the company that they would really like to hear and i'm not saying lie at all don't lie just let them know what your experiences are so now in engineering you can say ever since i was a kid i was interested in engineering and everyone around me noticed it and they,0,391.553,411.59,0
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_2_11,okay yes does that make sense perfect,2,449.766,454.949,1
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_1_22,i heard about that uh interview uh interviewer asked asked generally that why should we hire you,1,460.416,474.311,1

nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_0_23,the same thing you can tell them you should,0,478.624,481.389,0
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_1_23,your sales if you tell them if it's an engineering or an it field you can tell them i'm here to improve your processes i'm here to help you grow as a company or get better results quicker results,1,496.357,510.267,0
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_2_13,okay research is really important before an interview because the worst thing you can do when an interviewer asks you,2,510.607,518.646,1
nD7o6D0bvJY,nD7o6D0bvJY_2_14,okay like if an interviewer if i'm an interviewer,2,518.445,521.914,1

rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_6,we were when we were children i mean still now we are children but still we were kids at that time and we used to believe in ghosts and all that so i remember one time in my school there was a park we have a park in our school so we were just going there and we were discussing about all these supernatural topics and everything,1,110.584,131.629,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_6,are children but still we were kids at that,0,113.63,116.015,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_7,is every student's favourite topic because we also had,0,135.878,139.064,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_7,this supernatural thing in the school,1,140.748,142.974,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_8,at school i mean like haunting things related to our school suddenly i think the clouds came over the sun and everything went black and we were so scared that we just ran out of there immediately and didn't even think about anything we went to our school building and told everyone that something is wrong actually we didn't actually know about signs and that clouds can actually cover the sun and darkness,0,152.756,178.214,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_8,classes we understood that we were actually wrong and that was so and we were all we are still now we also laugh about that thing and of course a lot of other things we used to do that were so stupid and funny,1,188.19,201.496,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_9,okay so how did you all get,0,202.825,204.753,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_9,all get to know that it was very very stupid,1,204.411,206.64,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_4,because we got to know actually there are a lot of rumors about our school that it was probably i don't know what to say that um you know where the funerals happen and all those,2,208.649,222.042,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_10,say that um you know where the funerals happen and all those information ground right so it was that place before the school was there it's actually a rumor it wasn't so and we are always like trying to get out,0,216.136,233.127,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_5,yeah right so it was that place before the school was there it's actually a rumor it wasn't so and we are always like trying to get out every single thing that can happen i mean like everything this happened,2,223.905,239.159,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_10,ground right so it was that place before the school was there it's actually a rumor it wasn't so and we are always like trying to get out every single thing that can happen i mean like everything this happened this is of course because of the ghosts that are present there and now we don't because we have grown up and we know that that was just a rumor so now when we think of the things that we used to think as supernatural we find it pretty funny,1,224.326,252.835,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_6,okay yeah you know even i remember when i was in school uh we also had a classroom and it was i think of some section of eleventh class and when i was in i think third fourth or fifth class we also have this rumor that this particular section of eleventh grade it is haunted with a ghost and when we came to eighth ninth class it was so funny when we used to think about it how could we be so stupid and dumb that we believed that there was a ghost in that class every every school has these kind of supernatural memories,2,253.737,296.43,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_11,remember when i was in school uh we also had a classroom and it was i think of some section of eleventh class and when i was in i think third fourth or fifth class we also have this rumor that this particular section of eleventh grade it is haunted with a ghost and when we came to eighth ninth class it was so funny when we used to think about it how could we be so stupid and dumb that we believed that there was a ghost in that class every every school has these kind of supernatural memories so our uh session topic for today is would you rather change the past or explore the future,1,255.902,304.726,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_11,haunted with a ghost and when we came to eighth ninth class it was so funny when we used to think about it how could we be so stupid and dumb that we believed that there,0,272.892,286.293,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_12,like i'm quite sure about the answer because till,0,308.982,311.723,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_12,be needed for the future or something like that it's just a normal life so why to change the past when i have a pretty nice and calm and peaceful past of course i'd love to explore the future,1,318.208,328.795,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_7,okay okay so i'll ask you a question so uh would you if he uh if you're given an option that you can go into the past and meet your ancestors,2,329.938,342.651,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_13,a question so uh would you if he uh if you're given an option that,0,331.683,337.236,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_13,and meet your ancestors and the second option is all you can go into your future and see your great great grandchildren so what would you do,1,339.783,353.535,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_8,i'm sure i'm going to pick that grandchildren one great great grandchildren because i have just so many imaginative things about the future and everything and i'd also love to see what they look like actually i know a lot about the past right now we read in history everything i'm sorry i'm not really it's specifically about your ancestors,2,355.097,375.693,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_14,that grandchildren one great great grandchildren because i have just so,0,356.461,360.993,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_14,great great grandchildren because i have just so many imaginative things about the future and everything and i'd also love to see what they look like actually i know a lot about the past right now we read in history everything i'm sorry i'm not really it's specifically about your ancestors but still you know i know what they did or something like that but i would love love to know what happens in the future,1,358.346,384.71,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_15,okay okay so have you ever,0,386.056,387.84,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_15,uh want to become in the future what would you like to be,1,389.403,393.492,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_16,but now i'm suddenly confused i don't know what to pick course i'm going to pick science but you know what line am i going to go i have no idea of course i'd also love to see that what actually i become in the future if i ever can travel through time and look at the future,1,400.669,417.716,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_16,what to pick course i'm going to pick science but you know what line am i going to go i have no idea of course i'd also love to see that what actually i become,0,403.315,413.247,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_9,i think that's quite superficial and that cannot happen any time,2,418.477,424.185,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_10,okay so i'll ask you something i noticed that you said of course i'll take science,2,423.904,430.037,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_17,i'll take science so why did you add,0,427.479,430.9,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_17,is that obvious that you would take science,1,432.806,434.853,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_18,love science more than any other subject i don't get it history geography they're not my type i love maths as well but you know with science math always comes so if i take science i have to take maths so both of my favorite subjects are there i love languages but not as subjects so the rest that is left is science so that is why i actually love science,1,437.25,462.371,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_18,science more than any other subject i don't get it history geography they're not my type,0,437.49,445.159,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_11,okay that's nice you know when i was a kid i was exactly like you i love science and i loved maths these were my two favorite subjects especially when i was in ninth and tenth class,2,463.331,479.645,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_19,loved maths these were my two favorite subjects especially when i was in ninth and tenth class so these were my favorite subjects and uh when we got the option to choose you know our streams in tenth class so i was so sure that i'm going with some science and i took science with biology and maths both so when i actually started studying in eleventh class in the very first week i realized that doing biology and maths both it's very difficult so i eventually had to drop one of them so i in fact i like science even after till so i also was a science student but you know it's just a suggestion that i no no if not really a suggestion then just you know a tip that i'm giving you uh you know that it's very difficult to uh do both the things maths and biology both though i had a lot of friends who were pursuing with both maths and biology but you know they were always like why did we take this we can't do it and i was like see i told you it was you know it was that told you moment so many times in my eleventh class that i told you don't take match to uh biology but they were like no so i know these kinds of things keep happening so what message would you give to people in the past,1,474.998,564.512,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_12,okay so these were my favorite subjects and uh when we got the option to choose you know our streams in tenth class so i was so sure that i'm going with some science and i took science with biology and maths both,2,479.324,494.841,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_13,okay so when i actually started studying in eleventh class in the very first week i realized that doing biology and maths both it's very difficult so i eventually had to drop one of them,2,494.56,510.806,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_14,okay so i in fact i like science even after till,2,510.545,515.9,0

rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_24,than the offline mode no i don't because i think that interacting with the teachers like it's much better,1,776.367,783.211,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_25,and you don't really have a social life when you are doing everything online when you go out meet your friends you have so much,0,784.253,791.988,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_25,really have a social life when you are doing everything online when you go out meet your friends you have so much fun rather than you know sitting in your bed and taking classes,1,785.254,796.063,1
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_26,so this two years were like so tough for me i couldn't talk with anyone you know the teachers were telling me something i couldn't understand anything so i wouldn't love online but probably it can happen in the future that the education system will be turned to online i don't want it but it can so i'd love to know whether it happens like that or not and of course all these amazing gadgets and robots that are going to be made in the future i'd love to see what exactly how much exactly can science can go i will i'd love to know that,1,797.79,831.346,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_26,to online i don't want it but it can so i'd love to know whether it happens like that or not and of course all these,0,812.781,819.418,0

rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_0_28,not related to science for me you know how can you make science in that thing in time traveling you cannot you can never see the future how can you travel there and something else like past is different but future that hasn't happened yet that is the idea,0,871.872,890.18,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_28,can never see the future how can you travel there and something else like past is different but future that hasn't happened yet that is the idea is so bizarre so i don't know of course i don't have any idea but probably it won't because fast is i think it can happen like something you know you can travel in the past you cannot change it probably but you can travel but the future i can just see it how can it happen like,1,881.25,910.557,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_22,the time hasn't even come yet,2,910.918,913.163,0

rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_1_30,have really mixed feelings about this thing like i don't know where science is going to go but still for me right now it's impossible,1,923.703,930.663,0
rbD0AeZTfi8,rbD0AeZTfi8_2_23,think ninety percent this is not possible but you know you never know what happens and where science progresses nobody knows that,2,931.445,940.586,0

v4FC4z3mqB4,v4FC4z3mqB4_1_25,but now it is better than that not reacting is good not reacting is good i mean,1,496.138,501.749,1
v4FC4z3mqB4,v4FC4z3mqB4_2_16,reaction is needed but you know if you are sure if you're not sure and you know sometimes you're very confused and situations are really conflicting and it's like,2,502.591,513.111,1

zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_3,of a situation related to our health,1,38.184,40.586,0

zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_1,yeah i think i am really uh health conscious but you know uh like i'm a person who really are not kind of foodie or uh i don't love uh going out many times so that's why i think it's easy for me like if if a person who is really foodie he will face a lot of difficulties maintaining the diet and all that because it's easy for me to follow a simple diet and healthy food i don't go out too much so it's also easy the person i don't wake up i wake up early in the morning and i don't i sleep early so that is also good so,2,54.187,112.088,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_4,person who is really foodie he will face a lot of difficulties maintaining the diet and all that,0,73.408,79.942,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_4,i don't wake up i wake up early in the morning and i don't i sleep early so that is also good so i follow that so you can see that i don't wake up late i think that's what you were trying to say that i don't wake up in the night fine so you know one uh amazing way to say this would be i am not a night owl i'm not a night owl i am an early riser and i go to bed early too so that's one way to say it,1,105.75,135.619,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_2,ok so you can see that i don't wake up late i think that's what you were trying to say that i don't wake up in the night,2,113.607,122.243,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_5,it and then it came naturally so how was the process i didn't force really i don't know why but it's natural in me because i was in navodaya so there we have to wake up early at five am because we have that routine to go for the exercise and running that's why i think it's in me so that habit has been like ingrained in you over the years,1,145.268,172.717,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_5,but it's natural in me because i was in,0,152.951,155.88,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_6,let go of these good habits because now there are no boundaries there are no rules and such correct no one is monitoring them but you kind of stuck with it for so many years even after completing your education so,1,188.015,199.583,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_6,are no rules and such correct no one is monitoring them but you kind of stuck with it for so many,0,192.005,197.178,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_3,even now whenever i sleep late like after twelve am or like this i feel so guilty about it like how can i do this like this isn't me like i have to sleep between ten to eleven between ten to eleven that's a very good timing and it's a very rare thing these days because we are always glued to our mobile phones before we go to sleep right so do you also catch yourself doing it sometimes rarely watching netflix binge watching something,2,201.313,234.502,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_7,very rare thing these days because we are always glued to our mobile phones before we go to sleep right so do you also catch yourself doing it sometimes rarely watching netflix binge watching something i do but you know i decide everything in my diary like i have to watch an episode of,0,221.838,241.477,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_4,yeah i do but you know i decide everything in my diary like i have to watch an episode of a particular season like whatever i'm watching i'm not the kind of who watch two three episodes continuously no i watch i set that thing like i have to watch one episode and then,2,234.301,252.765,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_7,i do but you know i decide everything in my diary like i have to watch an episode of a particular season like whatever i'm watching i'm not the kind of who watch two three episodes continuously no i watch i set that thing like i have to watch one episode and then that is the news so you have like so much of self control and self discipline i really admire you for that,1,235.103,262.692,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_5,yeah that is the news,2,252.504,255.214,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_8,and it's a very popular saying that poor health poor physical health begins in the mind so what is your stand on this do you think it's true false or,0,264.796,276.142,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_8,very popular saying that poor health poor physical health begins in the mind so what is your stand on this do you think it's true false or do you have a partial stand,1,267.039,277.483,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_6,somewhere it's true i think because when you know it depends on upbringing environment and also what we think about ourselves like when you feel little bit of cold and you think like now i will catch the cold and i will have cough and all that then definitely will happen to you so,2,280.628,304.979,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_9,bit of cold and you think like now i will catch the cold and i will,0,292.976,300.191,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_7,yeah and the second thing like environment also affects according to me because it's a person who is living in a a place where you do a lot of stuffs for your health and for like if there is a winter season you wear a lot of clothes and somewhere people who live like they do their work and don't wear a lot of clothes and they feel comfortable in that so it also uh stuck in our mind that i am the person who catch easily hold and all,2,304.739,336.288,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_9,place where you do a lot of stuffs for your health and for like if there is a winter season you wear a lot of clothes and somewhere people who live like they do their work and don't wear a lot of clothes and they feel comfortable in that so it also uh stuck in our mind that i am the person who catch easily hold and all i'm someone who catches cold easily,1,312.297,338.412,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_10,it's all about like our immunity and surroundings and stuff like that right,0,340.896,344.91,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_10,like our immunity and surroundings and stuff like that right,1,341.759,345.171,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_11,instead of saying a place where we have,0,346.716,348.518,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_11,we have to wear a lot of layers,1,350.32,351.842,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_12,of layering a shirt a sweater a shawl it's one layer,0,354.305,360.323,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_12,a shirt a sweater a shawl it's one layer after another so that would be a better way to say it,1,356.3,363.065,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_8,let's say as you have already been through the session document i'll just summarize it once so if you have a very persistent headache and you've tried all the home remedies,2,366.297,375.603,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_13,tried all the home remedies but nothing's working it's still there and you finally decide that going to the doctor is the only option left so does the thought of going to the doctor make you feel worried or do you feel like confident and you're like let's go and get it checked you know honestly before corona it was like quite it's easy to go to the doctor but after corona it feels so somewhere like i don't know what will gonna happen what will doctors say about this and maybe he can suggest any particular examination so that's,0,373.938,408.982,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_9,okay but nothing's working it's still there and you finally decide that going to the doctor is the only option left so does the thought of going to the doctor make you feel worried or do you feel like confident and you're like,2,375.342,389.595,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_13,the only option left so does the thought of going to the doctor make you feel worried or do you feel like confident and you're like let's go and get it checked you know honestly before corona it was like quite it's easy to go to the doctor but after corona it feels so somewhere like i don't know what will gonna happen what will doctors say about this and maybe he can suggest any particular examination so that's now it's a little bit worry about a worry thing it's worrisome you can say that w-o-r-r-i-s-o-m-e worrisome,1,383.234,420.495,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_10,okay let's go and get it checked you know honestly before corona it was like quite,2,389.434,395.748,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_11,okay it's easy to go to the doctor but after corona it feels so somewhere like i don't know what will gonna happen what will doctors say about this and maybe he can suggest any particular examination so,2,395.328,411.304,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_12,yeah that's now it's a little bit worry about a worry thing,2,412.245,416.95,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_13,yeah so i agree with you it's the same case with me and even my family right before corona i think it was not that big of a deal now the thought of even just going anywhere near a clinic uh it's a hazard like uh more than the effort i think mentally you feel,2,423.642,439.55,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_14,the same case with me and even my family right,0,425.246,427.332,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_14,a viral fever what if we catch it,1,441.675,443.439,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_15,you have a family physician that you guys normally consult,0,449.241,452.471,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_15,have family physician right now but we had like my maternal grandfather was a doctor,1,454.674,460.863,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_14,okay okay good good do you try home remedies before going for strong dosages of medicines or do you directly go for the latter no i believe in home remedies more than the doctor's medicines or because you know like during corona we used to like the uh tulsi i don't know what to say in english,2,461.604,499.282,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_1_16,in home remedies more than the doctor's medicines or because you know like during corona we used to like the uh tulsi i don't know what to say in english i think that's what it's called so i started doing that and i twice in a week i drink with the water one leaf with water so i think that works a lot and whenever in my family a baby or a child get cold or catch any cough kind of stuff so i suggest that to give home remedies not to give a medicine or that the allopathy medications right so very nice i think tulsi thing that you mentioned it's somewhere followed in my home also my dad has a couple of leads early in the morning it's supposed to enhance your immune system is that what it is about,1,478.785,548.77,0
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_2_15,yeah i think that's what it's called so i started doing that and i twice in a week i drink with the water one leaf with water so i think that works a lot and whenever in my family a baby or a child get cold or catch any cough kind of stuff so i suggest that to give home remedies not to give a medicine or that,2,498.238,532.53,1
zn-uqMEqVI8,zn-uqMEqVI8_0_16,a child get cold or catch any cough kind of,0,521.025,524.848,0
